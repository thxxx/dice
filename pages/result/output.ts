          text: "I'm going to qualify that I'd give the restaurant a 3 1/2 stars for overall experience.Friday night around 6:30pm it wasn't hard to get either a table or seat at the sushi bar. We enjoy the bar experience so opted for that. Our server arrived immediately and was lovely. He told us about a couple of specials and gave us time to peruse the menu. He returned and took our order. Here's my first issue. He did not write anything down. I can tell you that of the (insert gross exaggeration here) 500 or so times that a server hasn't written down my table's order, 250 times either an item is forgotten or the server needs to come back to the table to confirm an item. So yeah, that 50% hits hard because I have no faith in the system. WHY? Saving on paper? The restaurant thinks it's swankier that way? Whatever the reason, I absolutely hate it. And, confirming my fear, our oysters were forgotten. We kept getting food and thinking they were coming. So by the end, we'd had enough, really, and asked for the check and reminded him the oysters never came.The food itself was very good. Had the uni nigeri special, amaebi, hamachi, unagi, Loco Spiderman roll and Special K roll. Would have had the oysters too, but you know that story already. I love to order ankimo but they aren't carrying it right now but it will apparently be coming back on the menu soon. I would like to call out the Special K roll as particularly spectacular: Yellowtail and avocado topped with seared butterfish and pickled jalapenos with truffle ponzu sauce. Honestly it was perfection and such a unique flavor that I was simply joyful. All the dishes were fresh and flavorful.Besides the forgotten oysters, the other thing we didn't love was that it was fast service...like really, really fast...too fast. There was no real soul to the experience. Get in, get your food, get out. We choose the bar for interaction and watching...however most of our plates were given to us by the server, not the chef, and again, it's all so fast that you're really not there to soak up any atmosphere.All in all, if I lived in the neighborhood, I'd order to go and eat at home. Given that I don't, we'll be trying somewhere else next time.",

          text: "Nara has a certain \"je ne sais quoi\" to the menu, which I figured out was that the menu is Japanese fares made by Koreans. You'll find non-traditional rolls like the loco Spider-Man roll and special K which are not anything you'd find in a typical sushi restaurant. The special K roll was kind of fishy, so the seared butter fish on top was not my favorite. Next time, I would just skip rolls all together and go for omakase or a La carte nigiri.The most stars go to the nigiri, which are pretty average-sized slices of fish. I did enjoy the uni, which were very sweet and fresh from Baja. The unagi was paired with grated ginger, which was a nice, refreshing touch. The golden eye snapper (kinmedai) was firm and tender. The service was slower as it was pretty packed, but the waitress was apologetic and accommodating. At the price point, I would prefer to go to other restaurants - so Nara is ultimately 3.5 stars being round up to 4 for the experience.",

The menu is simple and highlights their unique rolls and creations -- my favorite is the Special K roll. Some drawbacks are the cost for tea, and that you will pay for high quality fish but likely not leave full-- but I think that comes with the territory of nicely maintained and higher quality sushi places",

We parked on the street which was empty around the time we went and walked over to the restaurant which was completely empty aside from the staff making a few takeout orders so initially we were worried but once we ate, were surprised there weren't more people at such an amazing place.We ordered the Hamachi Truffle which was mild spicy despite having jalape\u00f1o and sriracha on top of the yellowtail. The truffle flavor wasn't overly in your face either so I absolutely loved this new dish! We also ordered the Blazing Glory Roll & Loco Spiderman Roll both of which were great and not spicy whatsoever. The first roll was literally on fire and that was really cool to receive! We were satisfied after such an amazing meal with such quick service. This place is such a gem in the city and can't believe it was empty but I'll definitely put it on top of my list for any sushi recs people ask of me in the city!",

We were greeted by the waitresses as soon as we went in (which shocked me as I don't know if SF customer service is below average or I'm just spoiled since we live in LV a tourist city) needless to say it was a welcome change from the cold respond we been getting everywhere else, plus they were SLAMMED BUSY.We waited about 20mins by the doorway (there wasn't any chair for waiting) we didn't have a reservation so I would highly recommend calling ahead for a RESERVATION. We were seated by the bar, and since the menu was by the door we knew what to order right away as soon as our waitress came. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 rolls, my partner was beyond pleased with how fresh and delicious everything is, and the food arrived pretty quickly. He especially loved the BLAZING GLORY, a roll that's wrapped in aluminum with a literal blue blazing trail next to it, DO NOT TOUCH THE PLATE IT IS HOT. Our waitress came back in 5 minutes to remove the foil for us and it was WORTH IT!Needless to say we enjoyed our brief dining experience here, (We are pretty low maintenance diners) we eat, we pay, and we leave.

Therefore, it benefits one\'s bank account to know a moderately priced omakase spot that is of reasonable quality, should one need to buy a date an omakase dinner while not appearing excessively stingy.We came here on a Friday around 7p and got seated right away, which was nice. We both ordered the 10pc omakase. The quality of the sushi was fine, but it wasn\'t really the "multi-course omakase vibe" that I was expecting because it all came out on a plate at once. I prefer the "one plate at a time" kind of sushi restaurant (e.g Sugarfish in LA or even kazunori).The quality of fish was fresh and decent, but also not sublime either, given the price point. I\'ve definitely had better fish in Japan and I feel like most mid-to-high tier sushi places in the bay area have comparable quality and are a bit cheaper.',

          text: "10/10 experience at Nara. Our waitress, Liz, was extremely welcoming and very knowledgable. She answered any questions we had of the types of fish: where they are from and how they are prepared. This night was one of the best experiences my girlfriend and I have had with any server. The chef's choice nigiri, like Liz said, was a great option for sushi lovers. They are 10 unique pieces, compared to the 14 piece sashimi (2x of 7 types of fish) Our favorite piece was the shima-aji (striped jack). The texture was firm yet tender and the sauce was slightly smokey. Definitely on par with the Toro and the Uni nigiri. Toro nigiri melts in your mouth. The Uni nigiri was so creamy and fresh.We also got the loco spiderman roll. This roll was pretty good. The exterior was too thick for my taste but flavors were definitely there. Can't go wrong with soft shell crab.I would definitely come back again for the food but also for the incredible service! You will not be disappointed here. Thank you again, Liz!!",

The place was not too crowded since we got there late and we got seated without any wait time. The menu had some cold appetizers, hot appetizers, and sushi/sashimi omakase or tasting and rolls. It wasn't a big menu but all the appetizers sounded good so we had a hard time choosing a few from them. We ended up ordering Hamachi Truffle, Shrek, Sashimi tasting, and Loco Crunchy roll. - Hamachi Truffle: nicely plated and good portion size, weaker ponzu flavor than expected, not sure jalape\u00f1o and ponzu matched with hamachi's little fishy flavor- Shrek: the appearance was impactful - looked like a green ball with avocado which contains crabs and fried tuna inside, avocado was not ride enough, crabs were really good and the spicy tuna's flavor was also nice balance- Sashimi tasting: they had 7 pieces (salmon, hamachi, kanpachi, madai, katsuo, shimaaji, sawara), all of them were thickly cut and rich, fish quality was also really good - especially sawara and kanpachi- Loco Crunchy: very gorgeous looking, good portion balance of fried tuna, and crabs, and the rice, a little hard to eat because the pieces were pretty huge especially with the fried spicy tuna on topThe service was also very good and there were many waiters considering the size of the restaurant and accommodated our request of changing the seat quickly, brought a small plate of salt when we ordered, good timing of taking the plates away when we were done.Nice ambience especially the bar and I would definitely come back here again to try other appetizers, other speciality fishes maybe by sitting at the counter next time.\"",

We also tried the otoro nigiri with truffle which was not included in the omakase. The Canadian uni was good, but not as good as Hokkaido uni. It tasted a little saltier but still worth trying. The omakase was delicious! Loved each piece, especially the hamachi, trout and snapper. The rolls were ordered were alright as well, maybe 3/5 stars. I would've ordered more nigiri. Our last dish was the otoro nigiri with truffle... it was so buttery and melt-in-your-mouth good. The truffle added so much flavor too.

Both get a passing glance from me as I had not found a reason to try it other than satisfying the occasional craving I have for kama (fish collar). Even though it has no relevance to this review, I've actually visited the real Nara. Yep, I'm talking about the city in Japan that has the world's largest wooden building and the world's largest bronze Buddha statue inside. I assume this restaurant is named for the city.At least it should be. Anyway, as luck would have it, I was walking in the Lower Haight when I saw Nara had just opened for their dinner service. It was time to give it a try. Sure enough, they had both yellowtail and salmon collar, but since the $9 Sake Kama was a full seven bucks cheaper than the Hamachi Kama, I ordered it and was quite pleased with how well it was grilled without drying it out (photo: bit.ly/3O8hIi5). The portion was just the right size since I also ordered the $33 Seven-Piece Sashimi Tasting.The server seemed disappointed that I didn't go for one of the $60+ Sashimi Omakase options, but frankly seven was all I could afford that evening. The sushi chef spread them out artfully on a dinner plate accompanied by a smooth rock, curled shiso leaves, and a bundle of decorative twigs (photo: bit.ly/3jyStrg). Hey, I was born in Japan, so I got the aesthetic vision before me. I tried to eat it slowly, but let's get real.

The fish tastes very fresh!I have been to Nara twice - once for my best friend's birthday last year and another time yesterday for my birthday! We made a reservation in advance for both events. I do highly recommend this - I looked at the Yelp waitlist when I walked in and the wait was over an hour at 6:30pm on a Saturday. Most folks sign up for Yelp waitlist on their phone via the app. Both times we went, we experienced great customer service. Yesterday, our server, Liz, was great and very attentive. I love that the food comes out rather quickly after ordering.My best friend and fianc\u00e9 are both obsessed with their O-toro nigiri and ordered 3 rounds of that yesterday. I like that they put a truffle on top of each of the O-toro nigiri. My favorites were the Special K roll and the hamachi truffle. We also ordered the Blazing Glory because we saw on the menu that it would be set on fire. I honestly thought it would be a cooler fire show but the sushi was wrapped in aluminum foil and the outside of the aluminum foil was set on fire. Meh. Not worth the extra cost to be honest.One thing I wished they did, especially for the amount we spend each time at the restaurant, was if they had a special gift for a celebration, whether that's a nigiri for the birthday boy/girl or even just a shot of sake!

Perhaps the best bang for buck sushi spot in San Francisco.We were hungry so we ordered the Fancy Platter. 3 rolls, some sushi, and some sashimi. Plenty of food. Well priced. And great quality. The fish was succulent and fresh. Definitely a meal I'd order again! You can tell that the chefs take pride in their work too. I loved watching their deep attention to detail as they meticulously assembled each roll. Seeing that passion makes you appreciate the meal that much more.

Sushi is one of my favorite splurge foods to eat so it's amazing that Toyama sushi has such fresh selections for a reasonable price because that means I can eat it more often! Toyama Sushi current reigns as my favorite sushi place in the inner Richmond for a nice sushi dinner that doesn't completely break my bank. We ordered the Uni nigiri which came out with heapings of fresh Santa Barbara Uni. It was fresh, creamy, delicious and satisfying. Two pieces for ~$22We then ordered their special 10 piece nigiri Omakase for ~$48. Which is a steal for the amount of fish they pack on there. The fish is fresh but I will say that if you are looking for extremely fresh fish, one that you may find at more expensive omakase style sushi restaurants - you won't find that here (obviously). But if you are looking for just some good quality nigiri (nothing too premium), packed with fish that will satisfy you - this is the way to go. Highly recommend! We also ordered their steamed egg which was not on the menu and recommended by the chef. So good! Super creamy and tasty. We also ordered the Emperor roll with the green Tobiko, it was very much on point and delicious. All their rolls are very reasonably priced as well. Love this place!",

I was really grateful that we were able to get a table (popular place) and I was particularly blown away by how generous the cuts were!Galaxy roll: Beautiful presentation, mostly fresh and bursting with flavor! Tiger roll: Loved the unagi and this was a perfect combo of CA roll and unagi together!!Sushi for 2: Great value (25 pieces!!) The sriracha was too strong/over-powering on the Toro; however the other sauces (maybe mango and a green one?, not sure if it was a wasabi sauce on some other pieces) were fine. Loved the variety, and the maki was especially good. Loved the long slices, plating, and overall filling nature of this dish (I'm always sad leaving a sushi place hungry lol)....The tea was great, too! Lovely cupsService was decent, too, though make sure to ask about the tea if they forget to bring some.

We arrived at 7pm and didnt get the omakase till 8:05 pm. On to the food, presentation reminded me of amani. There was kimchi(korean side dish) and a lot of other sauces on the fish which I didn't understand. I was expecting authentic Japanese food and not fusion. We got oysters as well which didn't come til after we finished all the food. We had to remind them that we ordered it. It looks like they completely forgot about it. The oysters came and had ketchup sauce over it, which shocked me. I never had fresh oysters with ketchup at an asian restaurant. I would rather go to Amani for the same price if not less. And I'm pretty sure, the fishes were not clean. I woke up in the middle of the night with an upset stomach. I will not be coming back.",

We were craving Japanese food, and this happened to be one of the only places opened for lunch on a Sunday.We ended up doing to-go. Their menu is quite comprehensive, with a wide variety of cooked Japanese entree items, to sushi. We both ordered the chicken teriyaki with tempura and California roll. The waitress on the phone was very clear that it would take 30-40 mins for our order, as there was only one chef at the moment. She said she would even call me when our order was ready! How nice! She called about 45 mins later and we were on our way for pickup. On arrival, she told us that they had even thrown in on-the-house spring rolls! How sweet! I haven't received an on-the-house item like that in more than a decade. Our order came out to $20 per order which was very inexpensive. \u00a0For the food, we were unfortunately kind of disappointed. The tempura batter did not taste right. The sushi rice in the California roll was all wrong - and I could see the chef's fingerprint in it. The on-the-house spring rolls didn't have the right taste. However, the chicken teriyaki was pretty good, but \u00a0I wish they gave more chicken instead of 60% rice, 30% chicken. My husband and I were super bummed about the food, as were so excited to try this place. The service was really great though, which is why I give them 3 stars.",

It seemed like they had a few regulars in there too, probably for a good reason.It's hard to think of good, constructive feedback.

We were seated and they gave us a complimentary egg roll for the wait. Because it was understaffed, our food came after 20 minutes. I'd say that the wait worth was it. The portions were huge. The SF giants roll was life-changing and it had everything we wanted: salmon and crab meat. The broth of the udon was perfect for the cold SF weather. Usually, the udon and ramen at Japanese restaurant aren't on par with the rest of the entrees, but this one was an exception. The beef and salmon teriyaki were tender, and it also had this potato croquette packed with so much flavor. The katsudon had a really interesting flavor since they added tomatoes. This unique dish also had a flavorful aftertaste. For the low price, the quality is too good to be true. I'll definitely come back again when it's less crowded.",

Upon arrival, a young lady greeted us immediately and checked out vaccinations. She asked which table we would like to be seated as she would need to sanitizer the table first. There was one big party and another table being occupied upon our arrival but it seemed that they were quite busy with to-go orders. After browsing the menus and asked the young man for couple recommendations, we started with the seafood ramen, gyoza, soft shell crab and the Omakaze. More people came in to pick up to-go order and it was obvious that the kitchen was running behind. It was confirmed when the couple spring rolls were brought to us due to the potential delay. We appreciated the gesture. More people came in to dine in while we were waiting for our food too.As the male server came back, we added one roll to our order. Both of the gyoza and the side sheep crab were good, especially the salad dressing of the \u00a0side shell cab. No sauce dipping sauce was needed for the crab neither. In terms of the seafood ramen, I am sorry to say that the egg didn't pass the test. The broth was interesting but not in a positive way. We have to say that the portion of the ramen was huge. In terms of the Omakase, it was the last order that was brought to our table. Chef / brought the order to the table himself and shared with us what we had. Texture and the cut of the fish were good for the price. The creativity was there with different combination. As much as we want to appreciate it, we would prefer something that would be more simple, less complexion with combination of fish and sauce because they overcome the taste of the fish itself. Solely personal preference. Overall, it was definitely worth to try!! As we follow up on the roll, it turn out that the male server didn't add to the tab. Which was okay as we were quite full. This review would totally be at least 4-star but not with the customer at the big party. The 49ner game was on, he wanted to cheer for them which was OK but he was screaming and yelling like there was no one else at the restaurant. He was LOUD!!! I had no doubt the staff in the kitchen could hear him. Couple other customers looked at him as he was crazy and disrespectful. He himself made the apology announcement to the rest of the dinners, but as his cousin said, he was not sorry. It was a obviouse restaurant not a bar but the owner did nothing about it. This let alone would prevent me from going back.",

I wish I remembered the server's name because he was very friendly and accommodating, but I guess I had one too many drinks (COLD SAKE & mango/lychee beer!).

We decided to try it out, and we did not regret it!The service was great, the staff were efficient and kind. We got seated very quickly and they took our order very soon after we got seated, the waiter answered a few questions we had about the food, and helped us decide on what to get. They checked in on us frequently, and I have no complaints. Very nice staff!I got the millionaire tonkotsu, and a sparkling yuzu peach soda. My partner got the fiery wagyu ramen, and we got a karaage chicken and gyoza appetizer to share. The food was fantastic! The karaage was the crispiest chicken I have ever had, the texture and seasoning were perfect. Best part is that we came during happy hour (which is 4-6pm and 10-11pm), so the karaage/gyoza appetizer was half off, for $5! Which is an absolute steal. Super delicious! The sparkling yuzu peach soda was also really good, it was a bit pricey ($7) but I personally thought it was worth it. Usually peach and yuzu are difficult flavors to distinguish in a drink, but I could taste both and they were balanced really well in the soda. I didn't think it was too sweet, and the cup was really big, so I still had plenty to drink after I finished my meal. Would recommend getting both of these! Especially during happy hour to save on the karage/gyoza.My millionaire tonkotsu was also delicious. It was a pork-based broth, came with some seaweed, half an egg, and two pieces of pork chasu. The broth was not the richest broth I've had, however the flavor of the broth was really good, and I think it is overall a really good broth. The egg was seasoned well, it was actually slightly sweet too! I just wish they gave you one full egg. The pork chasu was also pretty good, I would say the meat was a bit too fatty for my taste, but I thought the flavor was still pretty good! I also thought the noodles and their texture were great. Overall, not the best ramen I have had, but the portions were good and the flavoring was fantastic!My partner said that the fiery wagyu ramen was good, but too spicy for his taste. The waiter said that the ramen was a spicy level of 2-2.5 on a scale from 1-5. My partner said that the ramen itself wasn't too spicy for his spice tolerance, but the ramen was so spicy that it overshadowed the other flavors of the broth, and he couldn't quite appreciate all of the flavors. However, he did say that the flavor and texture of the wagyu meat were perfect. If you love spicy foods, I think it's worth a try! But otherwise, my partner said that next time, he will just get the millionaire tonkotsu, like I did. Aside from the food, the first thing that caught my eye in the restaurant was the decor! There was a whole wall full of Japanese posters: advertisements, magazine cutouts, movie posters. Behind and next to our table was a huge shelf with anime figurines and beautifully designed alcohol bottles. The decor was absolutely gorgeous, and I will be taking inspiration for my own interior decorating!Overall, the restaurant had great vibes, the food was really good, the food was fairly priced, and the staff/service were awesome! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to other people, and recommend that you try the millionaire tonkotsu and chicken karaage/gyoza.",

We quickly ordered from the happy hour menu. I got the hamachi nigiri, \u00a0chicken skewers, and then the Don Buri for a meal. I was not a fan of the chicken fried rice under the eel. Besides that, everything else was ok. The hamachi nigiri was the best. My sister got the bento box and was disappointed by the limited options that were all meat. The miso soup was watery and bland, and there were steamed veggies on the side... Overall interesting experience. Don't see myself returning. I do think we ordered the wrong things as it appears all the apps and small bites are the thing to do at this spot.",

The interior of the space is fairly small, but it's well-decorated with a lot of traditional Japanese pieces. With wood tones everywhere, it really does give the vibe of an Izakaya when you enter it. While some nights I've been able to be seated within minutes, other nights I've had to wait 30 minutes so wait times can vary quite a bit based on when you go. \u00a0 \u00a0For the food, I've gotten the pork belly skewers, the Braised Ox Tail, the Sashimi, and the Karaage. The food here overall is solid, although I think some items stand out more than others. The Sashimi and Karaage were both good, definitely on par with other restaurants I've been to that also offered the same items. However, I think the skewers are where this place shines. The pork belly skewer is quite fatty, but it's also tender and so it has a lot of flavor when you eat it. The Braised Ox Tail was an item that I hadn't had before, but I really enjoyed the taste of it and it goes well with the bread that they give. \u00a0 \u00a0Overall, if you want some authentic Japanese Izakaya food then this is the place for you!",

Just know that when ordering skewers, each order is 2 skewers. Sweet Purple Potato - crispy fries with a curry aioli dippingSkewers - these are all so delicious and perfectly seasoned. We had the angus tri tip, beef tongue, wagyu, pork cheek, and chicken thigh. Loved them all! Taishan Unagi Don - if you're an unagi (eel) fan, this is for you! Every bite was so flavorful.

It's a small little corner shop which houses quite a bit of people. \u00a0Came in on a Friday evening and luckily for us the wait time wasn't too grueling. We waited about 15-20min until they were able to seat us. Pro tip - check in on Yelp and receive a free Sapporo. Can't go wrong with washing down your meal with a cold glass of beer. We ordered the skewer sampler - wagyu, pork belly, asparagus, shrimp, and chicken thigh. All were pretty tasty. But at the same time they all tasted pretty similar. They kinda sat on like a teriyaki tasting sauce, so to me, they were almost all the same. Kinda wish it wasn't sitting in the sauce just so I could have enjoyed each of the different flavor profiles. The crispy lobster roll had to have been my favorite dish. I it came with lobster chunks and fried onion strings which I thought was a nice accompaniment. The okonomiyaki fell short for me. I've definitely had better ones from other restaurants. I probably wouldn't order this one again. It was the only dish that we didn't finish, which I was kinda bummed about because it was the one thing I really wanted. Over all a great experience. They even have a shelf of snacks that you can treat yourself to. Which I most certainly did!",

It's the \"grilled and sauced\" variety, with a special thick soy sauce that packs a ton of umami and deliciousness. \u00a0excellent drunk food.salmon ikura don: my favorite dish that can't miss, the salmon was super buttery and of course the ikura was delicious. \u00a0it's getting hard to find ikura with the supply chain shortage so I'm glad this place had it. \u00a0The place is very small and as a result the wait was a bit long (probably because it's so damn good!) even late, so unfortunately, be prepared to wait for 30+ minutes. My advice is to get a drink across the street at the liquor store - if you're going to see a show @ 1015 folsom like I was, a little pregame never hurt anyone. \u00a0Overall this place was extremely solid, so if you're in the area before 2AM when they close, it's definitely worth checking out. \u00a0I'll for sure be back.---sweet: delicious eats, open late!bitter: small place so lines are long. \u00a0Clearly this place is getting on peoples' radars after just a couple of months.",

We ordered through the phone for pick up, when we ordered the person on the phone told us it was spicy.. At first I was a bit nervous as I can handle spice but anything that's too spicy isn't enjoyable. The wait was about 20 mins but luckily I live about 2 walking minutes away. When we arrived to pick up our order, the restaurant didn't seem too busy. They had lights up, music playing, nice set up. I got the fiery wagyu ramen and it wasn't spicy TO ME, at all. The broth was so rich and full of flavor, this whole concoction tasted like Mongolian bbq without the broth. I usually hate steak meats that are fully cooked but these slices were so perfect, it paired so perfectly with the soup. For someone who isn't a big fan of ramen, I am so happy I found a spot near my apartment that has it so good and for so cheap! A bowl was $22 and the portion is huge, I was able to save some for the next day. I look forward to coming back and trying their sushi rolls, they all looked so good and budget friendly.",

The place is small so there may be a wait.Bonus tip: Don't forget to check in for a free beer!XXXL Crab Rolls: fresh snow crab California roll topped with snow crab, yuzu miso dressing, tobiko. Love the fresh crab and subtle yuzu flavor! More on the light and refreshing side.Karaage & gyoza: Fried chicken with house curry aioli dip. Comes with a good amount to share between 2-3 people.Chicken skewers: Tried the thigh and gizzard. Comes in two pieces, typical skewers. Flavorful but not the best I've had.. still can't go wrong with them though.Torikawa: seasoned fried chicken skin. Large portion, worth getting this vs. the skewers, in my opinion.PARKING: Street parking only and pretty hard to come by, garages available nearby.SERVICE: Great service! The servers made sure we were always tended to and cracked jokes with us through the night.ATMOSPHERE: Quaint traditional Japanese spot in SF. Definitely has that lively izakaya vibe.We were looking for a late-night dinner spot nearby and stumbled upon The Public Izakaya. We got there around 9:30pm and there was no wait, and we were able to order HH items once it hit 10:00. Noticed a lot of people started coming for HH, so I'd recommend coming early. Great spot for a variety of food and drinks, would definitely come back for happy hour again.",

The \"chashu\" is actually kakuni, but is somehow under seasoned and grilled so it's not tender and it's not flavorful.Decent for a late-night fix, but unexceptional.",

Since it was cold, we waited inside for about 10-15 minutes before we saw the waiter come and cross our name off the list? They then proceeded to call the party of 3 right after us. We spoke to the waiter and asked why they crossed us off the list, but they said it was just a mistake and we'd be next. After getting seated, we ordered off the happy hour menu as well as the cheesy oxtail. The happy hour food was just okay, and nothing really stood out to us. The cheesy oxtail was BOMB though. The tomato base with the chunky oxtail meat and cheese on bread? Delicious. The ambiance of the place was great, but the food and service was lacking. I definitely would only come back for drinks during happy hour and order off the regular menu.",

They honored our free Sapporo, upon check in, and got our food out quickly. \u00a0 \u00a0Now you can't go here expecting omakase, or tasting menu style service or quality, but you can expect decent service, good food, and all at a time of night where not many options exist. They are affordable, and have alot of drinks so get your buzz on if needed. \u00a0 \u00a0We ordered shisitos, cheesy oxtail, spicy tuna roll, Hamachi kama, and a sampler of skewers. All were delicious and \u00a0affordable. We would def come here again for the vibe and eats. Cute tokyo/anime themed decore and music. We liked it. \u00a0 I have 2 critiques: \u00a01. The A5 is not A5. Period. This is not debatable. But the price for the A5 skewers was not expensive. It was actually a delicious cut of beef grilled wonderfully. It was a higher grade than the regular skewer, But that is not A5.  \u00a02. The bathroom was very used at busy the late hour. Could def use more cleaning mid/during service. It's also long past time for a deep clean in there. Scrub scrub scrub.  \u00a0 Other than that I have no complaints. And we will be back sometime late at night with friends! We'll done! Cheers!",

The shrimp tempura was a fav at the table in addition to the salmon avocado. I got the spicy miso and it could've been spicier but the broth flavor was delicious anyways. The service is very slow tho, luckily we weren't in a rush so it wasn't a big deal but if you're in a time pinch this may not be the best option.Update: I changed from 4 to 3 stars cuz I wrote the review while waiting for the check but it's been over 20 minutes just waiting for the check so the service brought the rating down.",

We put our names on the list and we waited approximately 45 minutes. With 2 wait staffs, I felt like they were needing extra help. There was empty tables available by the entrance and I'm not sure why we still had to wait instead of us getting seated. What we ordered: - Tonkotsu ramen : My fianc\u00e9 ate this mostly but I go to try the soup and it was flavorful but a bit salty! They put a huge chunk of pork. I just wished the egg was a bit more yolky instead of boiled all the way. - Yakitoris: We ordered the beef tongue and 2 beef ones that I don't remember lol. They were all tasty and delicious. Overall I think they have time to improve with everything but I may come back again to try something else. I didn't think anything out of the ordinary from this spot.

I love the juicy thick chasu oozing with fat, but it's not the melt in your mouth level. I liked the wagyu as well, but the flavor is on the sweeter side, so if you don't like that, get something else. The only complaint I have about the ramen was the noodles, a tad overcooked. The toro sashimi was thick cut and was ok; I did not taste the fat belly much, it was just a hint - I've had better. I like the sparkling sake I ordered, it is the $16 (at the time of this review). If you are not a fan of alcohol taste, go for the sparkling sake. This one has a fruity taste and does not have an alcohol aftertaste. Light.Btw, do not forget to sign-in, you get a free Sapporo beer (for those of you who are fanatic of this beer, it's not the bottle kind, it's a can).This place gets busy really quick so I suggest going in early unless you don't mind waiting in line.

We ordered some of the robatayaki (grilled skewers), mussels, some sashimi, nigiri, karaage and gyoza. For skewers, I recommend the shiitake mushroom, pork belly, and Wagyu beef but honestly I thought everything was great. The skewers were well seasoned but not drenched in sauce. The sushi was really fresh and the toro was amazing! We tried their Yuzu-infused house beer which was great as well.The service was really friendly, had lots of good recommendations and were very attentive. There's also a really cute snack section on the way to the restroom which has everything from Hi-Chews to White Rabbit candies (very reminiscent)!

We ended up waiting close to 40-45 minutes for a table, even though there were only ~4 groups ahead of us.THE WAIT. Oh my goodness. Someone please teach the folks who own this restaurant the concept of turning tables to maximize revenue. The waitlist management here is a bit questionable. There was a table of a family where there were 3 kids playing games with the parents drinking sake. They'd long since stopped eating, but sat at the table for over an hour letting their kids watch videos on their phones while a line of people waited outside. Similarly, I saw a table that was empty for 30+ minutes before the host seated 3 people who had been waiting 45+ minutes for a table there. Why did they wait 30 minutes to seat those folks at a table that had been empty for half an hour already? I have no idea.In general I felt that the wait management here was not well-thought out. I think that may partly be because the resto is short-staffed, but nonetheless I think they can substantially increase their revenue if they put a bit more effort into managing their tables.THE FOOD.I ordered the wagyu ramen. it was VERY spicy, which I wasn't expecting, and very oily as well. I read a few reviews that this was the best ramen some folks had, but I did not agree. The wagyu ramen was WAY too rich, spicy, and oily. They also put spicy potato chips into the ramen which I've never seen before.My bf ordered the okonomiyaki and he did not like his dish either.The thing we liked the best was actually the tofu fries. But they literally give you like 5 fries. Go figure.Overall, a disappointing experience for a 45 minute wait. Perhaps I just picked the wrong dishes, because they DID have an extensive and interesting menu. But alas, unless I can get a reservation to avoid waiting, I won't be back.",

They've taken over Krua Thai which has moved in with Raw Sugar Factory on Valenica. They're open for takeout, delivery, and dine-in for lunch and dinner.For the covid conscious, staff wore masks. M E N UJapanese/Japanese-American Cuisine with a salmon-centric menu. Beer and wine only.*** Happy Hour Specials ***: 40-50% off select appetizers and drinks available EVERYDAY from 4-6 pm!-- Food: Dozen Oysters ($18), Housemade Ankimo ($8), Yakitori, 2 pc ($3.50-4), Chicken Karaage ($4), Gyoza ($4), and more. -- Drinks: Asahi ($3) and Wine by the glass ($5-$7).F O O D* Fried Oysters, 3 pc (HH - $4 // Reg. $8): tinyurl.com/p53mxpbbWe ordered the raw oysters but I think there was a misunderstanding as we received the fried ones instead. BUT, the fried oysters didn't disappoint!Hot, crunchy, meaty, and hella juicy. It was served with a ponzu dipping sauce. IMO, I think a thicker sauce like a tonkatsu or tartare would cling to the batter better. Nevertheless, it was a great starter.* Housemade Ankimo: Monkfish liver cooked in house sauce, tobiko (HH - $8 / Reg. - $12): tinyurl.com/3zyzuwphThe edges were a little dry but the ankimo was soft and creamy in the center...served a top a savoy soy based sauce and tobiko for pops of salty umami.* Grilled Short Ribs (HH - $8 / Reg. - $14): tinyurl.com/4uwbyyckThe LA cut, marinated short ribs were richly marbled, meaty, and tender with smoky, charred edges. BOMB. If you like Korean galbi, get this!* Scallop Mini Burger w/ marinated raw salmon, salmon skin (2 pc - $12): tinyurl.com/3ncbzuzzI liked the creativity of this app. The raw scallops and poke-like marinated raw salmon was very fresh and buttery with just the right saltiness but missing a textural contrast. I think having the fried salmon skin as a standalone layer (instead of mixing in with the raw salmon) will provide that. * Smokey Salmon: Applewood smoked fresh salted raw salmon w/ spring mix (8 pc - $20): tinyurl.com/4fextra2I slept on taking an action shot with the smoke dome but the applewood really infused a distinct and complementary smoky flavor to the fresh sashimi slices. It was served with kizami wasabi (soy marinated wasabi) and a side of mixed greens which IMO felt out of place. * Salmon Volcano: Half cooked salmon over rice w/ soft boiled egg, sweet house sauce, wakame ($20): tinyurl.com/frnftvnm Per our server's rec, we ordered the Salmon Volcano. A dome of white rice is draped with slices of salmon that's been torched, drizzled with unagi and kewpie, and then crowned with a soft boiled egg yolk + showered with tobiko. Slit into the yolk and let that liquid gold cascade down the sides before digging in. Delicious and satisfying with similar flavor profiles to a Lion King Roll sans the heavy usage of mayo/kewpie. The side of wakame salad provided a refreshing, salty sweet crunch. Even the cute cat was eyeing it: tinyurl.com/2p8uym5s!S E R V I C EOne man show at the FOH - our kind server was there when he needed him while trying to manage dine-in customers and takeout orders. Food service was very prompt and we were never left waiting long for the next dish.After posting my pics on Yelp last week, the owner, Johnny reached out to me to thank me for my visit and asked for feedback on how they can improve. I provided my feedback as noted above, as well as, suggestions for salmon-centric menu items and he was really appreciative. A M B I A N C ECasual and contemporary with exposed brick walls and a compact wine bar. Tables were spaced out, not cramped together. 90s R&B playing - TLC, SWV, Jodeci, Boyz II Men, etc. P A R K I N GChallenging street and residential street parking.Overall, solid soft opening AND I love the awesome HH deals! I was going to give 4 stars but I gotta give props to the owner for being proactive by solicting and welcoming feedback after my visit (didn't meet him when I was there). The industry can certainly use more business owners like him so 4.5 stars rounded up. IF you're in the city and want to get salmon wasted too, hit up Salmon Bar and give some love to this small local business!",

The salmon portion was huge and the skin was crispy and the sauce was amazing. I can see why they sell so much of this, and why it's their specialty. Seriously their crispy salmon skin was the best on this salmon.Salmon Don was fresh and filling. Nice presentation. The ankimo appetizer was our favorite. Fresh made ankimo with a smokey flavor and buttery profile and a great sauce.

          text: 'We were wandering around SF for the day before seeing a dragapella show nears Hays Valley and when we drove past this oddly named restaurant with a banner that said "Soft Opening" - I did a little reading on YELP and their website and decided we needed to grab a meal here before the Kinsey Sick "Oy Vey in the Manger" holiday show tonight. From 4-6 PM 7 days a week they have a very nice happy hour featuring many of their apps at 40-50% off and a number of wines by the glass that were also fairly priced so we made an early dinner out of a bunch of small plates to share. The highlights from this seafood forward Japanese style restaurant included a half dozen oysters (6 for $9 so $1.50/each), a monkfish liver cold dish which was divine ($8), shrimp wrapped in bacon and grilled ($4 for 2) and the fried calamari ($8) as well as the Korean short ribs ($8) and nicely fried Korean style boneless chicken thighs - and a little less successful but tasty were the fried oysters and the odd clam chowder croquettes !? We filled the table with food, had two glasses of decent white wine and had a solid early pre theatre dinner for about $30/each. We will be back for the mains - the miso salmon looked good and seemed fairly priced at $21/entree. Nice folks running the front of house who seem to know Japanese style seafood at fair prices.',

I also tried their Bacon Favor, it's a salmon topped with their special sauce. The salmon skin was crispy at the bottom really good. The fried calamari was crispy enough not soggy. Loved their homemade dipping sauce for the fried calamari. Their price range is average price. They have a wide range of wine and champagne selections.",

The portions of fish were quite generous. \u00a0The sides of rice and mashed potatoes that we chose were very good, as were the small salads that came with the meals. \u00a0I tried their home made (cold) fruit flavored tea and it was fabulous - reminiscent of a sangria with all the fresh fruit floating in it. \u00a0Since it was still happy hour pricing when we arrived shortly before 6:00 pm, we tried their french fries appetizer and liked them very much. \u00a0Our server Johnny was very friendly and helpful, although he was clearly overworked acting as the sole greeter and waiter for the whole restaurant. \u00a0But they are in soft opening mode so one forgives these things. When we needed his attention, he always came right away. \u00a0We will definitely go back for more salmon dishes. \u00a0Our only negative notes are (i) the side of broccoli that came with my fish was cold (and I don't think it was supposed to be) and (ii) most of the restaurant is somewhat dark; unless you are there for a romantic meal, it may feel a bit dark to you. \u00a0Fortunately, we were seated on the side of the restaurant with better lighting, near the bar.",

We loved the consistency of the soup, and how the egg was perfectly cooked. We also got the ramen additions, black garlic oil and the spicy miso paste, and they were good and very big portions. We realized we could have shared some of that amongst ourselves instead of ordering it per person. Next time, I wouldn't get the paste addition unless I was really craving it!Service was great, and everything came out at a good pace!",

Izakaya Sozai is on the smaller side, though there is outdoor seating in a parklet, and they were consistently full from the time we got there to the time we left. We found parking pretty difficult in the residential area that surrounds the restaurant and only found a street parking spot after circling for a good 15 minutes. I do think parking on Lincoln Way bordering the park would probably be your best bet, but just use caution when crossing that busy street (especially at night and in places where there aren't traffic lights).You access their menu via a QR code taped to the table and they have a pretty decent mix of raw and cooked options. After perusing the menu we decided on:*duck skewers (2 pieces with Karashi, crispy leeks) - 10.50*tonkotsu ramen (comes with chashu, 1/2 soft boiled egg, green onion, seaweed) - 17*salmon onigiri (grilled rice ball w/ salmon, bonito flake, green onion) - 6.50*braised pork belly kakuni (5 pieces - sweet soy braised pork belly, 1/2 soft boiled egg) - 11*beef tongue - 8.50*pork jowl - 9*takoyaki (6 pieces) - 8*miso eggplant (grilled eggplant with saikyo miso) - 10.50*agedashi mochi (lightly battered and fried rice cake in dashi broth) - 11*agedashi tofu (lightly battered and fried tofu in dashi broth) - 11*side of rice - 2.50The kitchen churned out all of the items really quickly except for the ramen. By the time the ramen came out, we had finished most of what we ordered and were quite full. However, the broth is really rich and delicious and we couldn't resist finishing it at the restaurant when it was piping hot. If you like mochi, and dashi broth, I would highly recommend their agedashi mochi. It's not something I've seen at a lot of other Japanese restaurants so definitely go for it here. The miso eggplant was the one veggie dish, haha, and it was absolutely delicious over rice. It's served on a nice stone plate that kept it warm for a while which was a huge plus. I normally don't go for takoyaki because it always feels like a \"where's the octopus\" hunt through all the breading, but Izakaya Sozai's take on it is something I'd order again. They're about half the size of the usual takoyaki so you don't get a, IMO, warped breading to octopus ratio. I loved the duck and pork jowl skewers the most. Beef tongue was good, but tougher texture-wise than I'd like. The only two things I wouldn't order again are the salmon onigiri and the braised pork belly. The salmon onigiri was pretty bland and mushy and I'm really not a fan of soft rice. As for the braised pork belly, they give you nice fatty chunks, but the pork just felt overcooked and dry. All in all, I would absolutely come back here again and would like to try more of their raw options.",

Came here for the ramen again and it was not good... Overall, I'm not in a rush to return and don't think I will anytime soon. It's a bit expensive for the quality and quantity too.**Tonkotsu Ramen**A $17 bowl served with chasu, 1/2 soft boiled egg, green onion, and seaweed. I added on spicy miso ($2) and mushrooms ($1). Was this $20 bowl of ramen worth it? Definitely not. The noodles were also overdone so there's no chewiness...just really soft noodles. The broth is different now and is definitely not tonkotsu. It's like they put some kind of thickening agent in it so you don't actually get that rich and creamy flavor. It was just murky, kinda starchy (bc of whatever thickening agent that was used), and underwhelming. **Chicken karaage**Served with spicy mayo and fried green peppers. The chicken was juicy (dark meat) but it was too salty so the lemon helped a bit. It was whatever seasoning was sprinkled on top - not the chicken itself. The batter was okay...it didn't stay crispy so eat it fast!",

Although it's a fairly small place, the ambiance is intimate and perfect for dates. It's also open kitchen so you can watch the food being made. Menus are on a QR code. We ordered the agedashi tofu, tonkatsu ramen, chicken karaage, as well as the duck skewers and mizu tako specials! The agedashi tofu was crispy and flavorful, probably the best one I've had yet! The ramen and chicken karaage were pretty standard, but nonetheless delicious. The duck skewers were well seasoned and came with a wasabi paste that paired really well with the fattiness of the duck. The mizu tako was really fresh and tasted interesting, but I don't know if I would order it again. Food comes out fast, and the servers are very attentive and friendly.

Our group of 6 came on a Sunday for dinner and were seated outside. They had a digital menu and we ordered tonkotsu ramen, veggie ramen, agedashi Tofu, gyoza and salmon onigiri. The appetizer stuff came out first so we were just waiting on the ramen. It took OVER AN HOUR for the ramen to come out. A server came and we asked them why it was taking so long and she gave a very BS excuse of "it usually comes out at the end". A couple minutes later another server came to ask if everything was okay and we STILL had yet to get our food. She said she would check, but another 10 minutes passed and my friend had to go in and ask them. I seriously wanted to get our check and go down the street to Saiwaii ramen, but I was too hungry, hoping the food would come soon. When the ramen finally came, omg.... truly the most underwhelming bowl of ramen I\'ve seen (as you can tell from my photo attached). My friend said her veggie ramen was super salty and my tonkoshu ramen was so sad looking. They definitely forgot about our ramen orders and didn\'t even apologize for it or offer an explanation.

There is a street right next to Sozai that you can park in, which is free and plentiful. Took me two minutes to find a spot, which is amazing!SERVICE: Fast with polite staff! We were seated in five minutes upon arriving in an outside booth, which was safe, protected from the elements, and gave a homely feel to our meal.

The Albacore had really complex flavors with earthly and spicy undertones. The sausages were really good with the sauce and is a must try. The sausages were very light and not overwhelming in fat nor flavor. The ramen was super good and the egg was perfectly cooked. Though I must say, the toppings for the ramen are bare with just some seaweed, an egg, some woodear, and green onions. However, the broth and noodles were perfect!

I have first heard of Izakaya Sozai about 4 years ago when my sister and I passed by it and she said, \"Oh, my friend and I went and she said it's the most authentic Japanese food in the city.\" And since then I've lied in wait. Waiting for a chance to come here and every time we drive by, only to eat somewhere else, I wait. I walk by during the day, begging for a peek behind the blinds. And finally, I got my chance to come here after 4 years of waiting. My sister's friend (another one because she is oh, so popular) flaked on her and she asked me, \"Wanna go to Izakaya Sozai\" and FINALLY - it was time. The inside was smaller than I thought it would be but it was truly a small, homey vibe. On a Saturday night with reservations made the same day, we were promptly seated. And now, humans, this is the review: Takoyaki: lots of batter. When it comes to takoyaki I prefer more batter, less octopus and this had the perfect ratioChicken skin skewers: It's ALL skin and yeah, the name gave it away but I was not expecting ALL skin. I personally didn't like this because it was salty and again, was all skin. I don't know why I thought it would have some meat when it said chicken skin but my sister loved it. Chicken thigh skewers: nice and saucy~ The meat was juicy and tender with a light smoky flavor Bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms: oh YUM. I've recently discovered my love for enoki mushrooms and this was just great. The bacon wasn't too salty (I don't know if you can tell but I don't do well with saltiness) and the enoki mushrooms were the perfect amount of chewiness. Squid Ink Okonomiyaki: it was great! I forgot what okonomiyaki is supposed to taste like but if it tastes like this, I like it. If you don't really like squid, don't worry too much, the squid ink portion didn't add nor did it take away much but you can still kinda taste it. It's just not very strong. Pork Sausage skewers: again, I don't know what I was expecting but the pork sausages were not what I thought they would be. First, they tasted great with whatever yellow sauce that was on the side, but I was expecting it juicier and less smoky - even though it was a skewer that is grilled like what was I thinking? Agedashi Tofu: again, why is my perception/expectations of food skewed (heehee). I thought it would be cold but instead it was nice and warm, delicious with a light breaded outside, slightly soaked in the sauce that surrounded it. Gyoza: let me tell you, it was gyoza. The only food that didn't subvert expectations. TLDR: I liked it! Met expectations and I'm looking forward to when I get to come back in 4 years",

Every dish is executed beautifully and such high quality in taste, plating and creativity. I have never had a bad dish here. I'm guilty of always ordering my favorites but today I had the pleasure of trying something out of my wheelhouse and it was phenomenal. My starter was a blue fin tuna with ricotta cheese. I would have never though cheese and fish would go together. It melted in your mouth. The creamy cheese with the cold fatty fish was a delicious pairing. The chicken skins are a family favorite. We always have 2-3 orders each visit and they are able to do it without sauce since my daughter loves it for the crunch. The bacon wrapped enochi are my husbands favorite and mine is the bacon wrapped mochi. Their beef tongue is always tender and juicy and grilled to perfection. The kids also recently started to like the pork jowl. It's chewy, crispy fatty goodness. The grilled hamachi collar is my moms favorite. My husband always looks at the specials since he is more adventurous than me when it comes to eating. If you have food allergies it is safe here. The staff is more than happy to answer any questions and even customize things if they are able. Like today they made a yaki onigri without salmon for my kids :) they gobbled it up. Do be respectful if you are asking for an off menu item. If they are busy or can't, don't be upset.The star of this place is the tonkatsu ramen. I don't like noodle soup or ramen but this place I crave and like. The rich broth and perfectly Al dente noodles pairs with the perfect runny egg and sweet soft roasted meat is heaven in a bowl. In all fairness I don't drink the broth but the noodles coasted with the great rich broth is so delicious. I always eat my egg first since it is my favorite! The best part of the dish is that you can order a side of noodles :) we do that for our kids since their absolutely got nuts for the noodles. So if you don't drink the broth like me you get dipping noodles as a bonus! The pricing is fair and please support and tip their staff. We need to keep these gems in San Francisco. Their staff is absolutely sweet and attentive. We've come here for special occasions like my FIL visiting from Korea to craving ramen and skewers to not wanting to cook.

I hadn't been back until recently, when we came for an early dinner (and so missed the bar-ish vibe that I remember from before). In my memory food quality was very high, and that memory was re-confirmed during this trip. We ordered two different noodle dishes (Tonkotsu Ramen and Kamo Soba) for our entrees and two skewers (chicken skin and beef tongue) as appetizers. All were scrumptious. I always like beef tongue, but usually have it in the form of lengua tacos in which the texture and flavor are masked somewhat. There was no masking in these skewers and it was glorious: juicy, flavorful chunks cut into segments so the entire contents of the skewer doesn't slip off the skewer and onto your cheek when you take a bite. We ordered the chicken skin skewer at the suggestion of our waitress, who described it along the lines of \"crispy, warm, greasy, all things delicious!\" It was all of this - a nice (but not excessive, a la pork rinds) amount of crisp on the outside, a subtle chewiness on the inside, and a lovely (fried chickeny?) flavor all through. The noodles were equally awesome. The tonkotsu was all you would expect from a legit ramen joint, perhaps with the exception of the boiled egg, which was not a hundred-year egg, but was marinated or pickled or otherwise extra-flavorful. The whole thing was soul-warming and delicious (the former of which was especially important as we were sitting outside on a cool day). She also ordered spicy shoyu as an add-on, which came on the side and so I could also add it to my noodle bowl as well. Speaking of which, the soba was great - it was especially meaty (duck, which was subtly seasoned and perfectly cooked) with a broth that I would gulp down by the liter if that were on offer. A note on service: they were not only friendly, but enthusiastic, as well as efficient. And while the ambience was not what I remember it from before, this is still a fun place for dinner (or for lunch, if they served lunch, which probably no one would mind).",

I would not recommend eating here again. 1. Food: Food was mediocre and the tonkotsu ramen was so salty it was almost inedible. I don't understand why people get the ramen here, it is not good. I am someone who likes to liberally salt my food and I usually don't think food is too salty. This was bad. The broth tasted like there was a ton of salt and no other flavor. The scallop skewer was very good. I would just stick to the small plates and not order the ramen again, which seems counterintuitive since everyone seems to be ordering the ramen. 2. Service: As other reviews mentioned, if you are dining alone I would avoid this restaurant. The staff seemed displeased to serve a table for 1 (at an hour that wasn't very busy, around 5:45pm on a Sunday - there were open tables). It made me want to leave as soon as possible. I spent about 30 minutes total seated. When I was seated no one took my order for awhile, no one brought water until after I ordered and asked for it. I thought this was normal until I noticed later in my meal that the tables of 2 and 3 seated near me were fully served and also read the daily specials that weren't listed on the online menu, which did not happen for me. I finished my water early in the meal as the ramen as mentioned above was so salty and no one offered to refill it. Because the ramen was so lacking in flavor, I added on the spicy miso ($2) after it came. The server apologized after forgetting it and finally brought it out when I was almost done with the ramen. This is the first ramen restaurant that I've been to that doesn't have free spicy chili oil on the table as a condiment. I wish I had just brought my own. It feels like a pho restaurant charging $2 extra for hoisin mixed with sriracha. The miso didn't really taste like miso and dissolved into what looked and tasted like togarashi flakes (also usually free) once it hit the broth. I had been debating whether to come here or my favorite dumpling restaurant down the street and it is no contest. I would 100% recommend eating at one of the many authentic Asian restaurants in the area instead.",

Their portions and pricing is great and well worth the money but it also depends on what you order.I do not recommend their sushi but there is plenty of other dishes that I highly DO recommend. Their chicken karaage has really good flavor and is nice and crunchy! Some other dishes that I highly recommend is their tempura(nice and crunchy and not oily), sukiyaki, beef amiyaki, salmon teriyaki, and the best part is that all of these dishes are either all or can be combined together with their combos! We usually do pick up and the wait time for pick up is about 30mins and so far our orders have all been spot on!!!",

We both ordered a beef teriyaki bento, but the beef was extremely thin and the sauce was alright very syrupy and not really saucey. I loved the salad with the dressing. The dressing was refreshing. The tempura was good and crispy good and it was a wide selection of things shrimps and vegetables.The philadelphia roll was amazing. The avocado in it complemented it really well. I eat a lot of philadelphia rolls since it's one of my faves. But definitely won't go back just for just a roll.The tofu appetizer was okay. Definitely not a good tofu selection they picked for the appetizer I would have preferred a soft tofu in stead of firm. The service was good the people were nice. But overall I would give this place 3.5 stars.",

Fujiyama-Ya is a small Japanese restaurant in the Sunset that serves a variety of authentic dishes. You really can't beat the quality of service and value you find here. The same family has been running this place for over 30 years. More often than not, there is a wait to eat here. I recommend getting here as soon as they open. If you see a line, be sure to go inside and write your name on the white board. They call people in order, based on seating size availability. I've tried many things here over the years. Their combos are really the best value. You can get a lot of food and the prices are amazing. My favorite combo to get is the Sukiyaki with Sashimi. The Sashimi default is tuna, but I usually ask to change mine to hamachi. The combos come with miso soup, salad and rice. I almost always have leftovers. Be sure to get hot tea to go with your meal!",

Cooked food is alright.We ordered: -16 pieces sashimi, all the fish had no taste. There were no freshness to it, the colors are dull, I suspect it's been sitting around for a long time.-dragon and caterpillar rolls, both were ok, the fish on top were thin and too much rice.-Uni is the worst, tasted foul and I had a stomach ache after. Costed $7 each piece (so not worth it!!!)-Cooked food were tofu ( they used the firm cheap tofu, texture wasn't good), beef sukiyaki ( way too sweet) combo tempura ( probably the only dish I liked that night).Over all, 2 out 10.

We got seated but waited an additionalb5 minutes after to order since they were taking walk in orders before they finally got to us. Had ordered our food, chirashi, tempura udon, seafood udon (sorry no picture), ahi poke and soft shelled crab. Portion for the soft shelled crab was a bit disappointing. Only one crab as an appetizer. The ahi poke was also in smaller portion and it DIDN'T taste right. It tasted it was a day old and the flavor was plain. The tempura udon was okay, the soup was bland so I had to add soy sauce for flavor. The tempura sauce was sweet compared to other sauces I've had. The tempura itself wasn't in my opinion fully cooked since it was a little doughy still.The chirashi had only 4 types of fish and the the rice wasn't flavored nor was there enough. It seemed liked they just did a scoop and a half and flattened it against the bottom of the bowl.All in all, tried this place once, won't be going back.",

The tempura came with 2 shrimp and vegetables and was nice and crispy. The dipping sauce could have been more salty. The beef sukiyaki came in a small iron pot was tasty. The salmon was good but I'm not sure why the sauce was a bit gooey. The sashimi was fresh. Rice came in its own pot.

The one thing that can be tricky is that Fujiyama-Ya isn't open for lunch hours, but the restaurant makes a great place for dinner. The establishment is cozy, and seating can be difficult to find during peak business hours. However, of all the times I've come here with my friends, we've had to wait only for a couple of minutes (if not at all) for a table.What I love most about Fujiyama-Ya is that I can get higher-quality sushi at a relatively affordable price. A California roll made with real crab (my favorite sushi item to order at any Japanese restaurant) only runs me about $5-6, compared to $9-11 at other places. The sashimi here also tastes pretty fresh. I've yet to have issues with food poisoning *knock on wood.* In addition, their cooked dishes are also delicious. In particular, I've tried their yosenabe and thought it was really filling and hearty. Good comfort dish, especially when that San Francisco chill hits. Overall, I couldn't recommend Fujiyama-Ya enough. Just be mindful of the wait, depending on when you arrive.",

The plates were sticky, dust covered the walls, and it made me very uncomfortable. It took forever to place our order, but it was busy and Christmas Eve so that's fine, but their combo meals are just so confusing?? It says you can create your own combo meal set, but maki sushi rolls aren't included. The food portion is also sooo small. I wasn't even full after my meal. Also, my family ordered a bunch of combo meals and the rice came in one container?? It didn't feel like we had our own meal. The food was probably 3/5, but I can't give them anything higher than 1 star because I was really disturbed with how everything was sticky and dusty.",

Its SF so you'd think that'd be easy, its not.So far I've found \"expensive and ok\" or \"expensive and not good\".This place was \"inexpensive and good\" on the Tempura, so I'm going here instead of all the way to Japan Town next time I want some.I also was interested in a bunch of their dinner menu items and thats actually what convinced me to go. I got there and decided I wanted sushi instead anyways, so thats what I got. You order per piece and its actually really affordable compared to a lot of other places in the area. What I got was fresh and they had most of the things I wanted (AmaEbi, Hotate, Saba, Unagi) so that was a nice. They were out of Mirugai but I haven't seen any in the markets lately so it may just be out of season or not be in high demand.Small Hot Sake was $5 and with it being cold for SF (46F) it was a nice treat.They even tossed in some Miso soup for free (which some places charge $2-5 for now), I never order it but it was also nice.Its not fancy but it is comfortable and I chatted with a couple locals while in line so I made a good choice tonight.

I got the 49ers, and they forgot the creamy sauce so the sushi tasted dry. My friend got the beef teriyaki thing they had and it didn't look appetizing. They drenched it in sauce like it was too much. The waiter was also not very attentive, and I asked for some water but she forgot about us.",

If you are looking for a meal that won't break the bank, and where your money will go a long way, order from Fujiyama! A friend of mine recently moved into the neighborhood and after a day at the beach, we were all craving sushi. I had never heard of this spot, so of course I hopped on Yelp, to get the low down from the community. I had to rub my eyes together because I was like is this menu from 2005, why are the prices so low? lol But nope, the prices were really that affordable. I ended up getting the bento combo for $16.95 which came with sashimi, order of assorted tempura, beer teriyaki, rice, salad and miso soup. We also added some rolls to the mix.For takeout, the tempura held up pretty well and tasted pretty good. The sashimi tasted fresh, and the beef teriyaki was passable. Most of the rolls here will be under $12 and for SF that's a crazy good deal. The escolar was awesome, and the salad & miso soup were middle of the road. Calling ahead is definitely recommended and making sure you go-over your order is important. At pickup there was a sligh mixup, but they were able to make good and get the order right. Good customer service and if I'm in the area again, and I'm trying to not break the bank, best believe I'll be back.",

You know, the bento boxes, the teriyaki dishes and the sushi rolls etc. Tonight, I had an urge to get some saba (mackerel) ($12) and shrimp tempura $7. The food wasn't bad. The shrimp tempura had a good crispy and crumby batter. But the shrimp tasted powdery. The saba tasted ok. It wasn't great. I'm not sure why they served it with orange slices. Usually, I like mine a bit salted with some lemon and perhaps some grated daikon radish. I did like how they served teriyaki sauce on the side. Sweet teriyaki sauce served on top would have ruined that grilled salty saba taste. Service wasn't bad. I wasn't served tea or checked on after my food arrived as they were pretty busy. The food did come out in a reasonable amount of time. My tab with a large beer was $35 with tax and tip. I'm glad they were open and the little old women working is still doing it after all these year. Good for her.",

The staff are super friendly and ones that know people in the neighborhood. The conversations (that I listened into) was just wholesome.I got an Oyako donburi and agadashi tofu. The food was served with a bowl of miso soup and a side plate of salad. The Oyako Don was delicious; plenty of egg and to my surprise, had other items like carrots and mushrooms. The agadashi tofu was yummy too, except for the fact that most of the tofu was undercooked - the fried skin was instead chewy and pastey - hence the four stars.Would definitely come back to try their rolls or whenever i need an almost home cooked meal.",

We got the deluxe sushi combo, and a couple maki rolls. Food was pretty good, all the fish tasted good and fresh, the rolls were well flavored and we enjoyed everything.

I came in on a Sunday afternoon and there were plenty of seats open, so didn't need a reservation, but I can this place getting busy during dinner time.I ordered their Carpaccio and it was yellowtail and their Toro Cakes. Yeah, you need to order both of these... both of the dishes were life changing. The quality is A1 and I just had to laugh every time I put one of each in my mouth BECAUSE THEY WERE THAT GOOD OF DISHES!I need to come back and try out more food!",

I took my girlfriend from England here after hyping this place up for months, and the first appetizer brought out was burnt and tasted nothing like the original. (Brussel sprouts). The drinks barely tasted like cocktails, their version of old fashioned tasted like whiskey on the rocks with a lemon that drove by and said hi but never stopped. I think post Covid we all have to accept that some of our favorite number one spots have forever changed, and they will die out slowly.",

I made reservations for 6pm on a Wednesday but we got there half an hour early and they were able to seat us without an issue.For starters, we ordered Toro Cakes, Miso Glazed Cod, and Shrimp Shumai. The Miso Glazed Cod is the BEST dish on the menu. The cod was soft and just melts in your mouth. The Toro Cakes were also delicious! It usually comes with three pieces but we were able to get a fourth piece so our entire group can have one. We then ordered three rolls to share. In order from my most to least favorite we had the Citrus, Midori, and Three Samurai. All the rolls were beautifully prepared and tasted fresh. The atmosphere was nice and I'd definitely come back to try some of their other dishes.",

I was shocked, but honestly pleasantly surprised. Now, we had to wait ~25 min after our original time due to previous guests, but the owner/manager offered us complimentary first round cocktails and that boosted our moods (though we were waiting patiently! We understand the restaurant business can be touch).I was so happy with the nigiri. We ordered hamachi, toro, and ikura. The hamachi was a nicely sized, very neutral and delightful. The toro melted in my mouth, it was just so fatty and had so much flavor. The ikura, the server said, was actually from a salmon they brought in and were surprised to see had roe in it! The ikura was subtle, not too salty, and was a great palette cleanser.We also got their umami and pork sliders. I will say, I hated the bao bun they used - it was too spongy and soggy and got caught in my teeth. HOWEVER, the inside of the sliders were fantastic. My favorite was the pork sliders because it had a wonderful wasabi coleslaw. The umami was a nice little smash burger. Their tuna tataki is a MUST GET. Please, try this item. It is so delicious.Their cocktails were pretty good. I would get the mukashi and paper crane again. We also tried Mrs Roboto but I thought it tasted like a lemon drop, so if you're into that, you should get that but I'd skip for myself.Service was great!Overall great time.",

He helped us figure out each order and proactively gave us recommendations, and asked questions about our meal. If you are in San Francisco, this place is a must-try!Order: We started with the miso, which was delicious and comforting; you can't go wrong with miso. We then ordered the Poke Tacos, which were flavorful and crispy. An enjoyable and perfectly balanced snack!We then got the Chopped Little Gems which was okay, nothing crazy. After that, we got the Umami Sliders which were incredible and melted in your mouth. For our main course, we got the Wiki Wiki Roll & Citrus Roll which hit the spot and left us stuffed!And to finish, we got the Brownie Dough Roll which speaks for itself, so you need to try it right now.",

          text: "\"If I were to choose a 'last meal', it would be everything on Mamanoko's menu\" - the dinner table quote which best sums up our experience The food, the service, and the atmosphere at Mamanoko are all top notch. We stopped by on a whim, and I am so glad that we did. We arrived right at 5pm and were seated immediately without a reservation. Based on the looks of the restaurant when we left -at capacity- , I'd suggest making a reservation. The service was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. They gave fantastic suggestions, although I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.The food was unbeatable -- fresh, flavorful, and carefully crafted. I highly suggest planning to share plates so you can taste a little of everything. The carpaccio was a highlight -- the tangy ponzu-like sauce paired with the pepper on top of the sashimi made for a beautiful combination. The umami bun looked like a burger, but stepped away from traditional with its Asian inspired flavors and bao bun. My table ordered 4 sushi rolls - the spicy tuna, hotsui, mamasan, and citrus. The citrus was unlike any sushi I have had before- it had a partial lemon slice on top. The lemon made the dish feel very light and floral. My personal favorite was the Hotsui -- it was savory with a twinge of spice from the hot sesame oil. Perfection. I'm looking forward to going back to Mamanoko to try the rest of the items on the menu.",

We ordered a couple of drinks. Very unique and both were tasty. The spirited away tasted like an old fashioned. I had a sip of my friends la pagoda. I'm not usually a fan of tequila but this had a nice balance because of the hibiscus and lavender bitters. For dinner we had the sliders, which I would definitely recommend.

          text: "My girlfriend and I \u00a0came to Mamanoko right as they opened for Saturday dinner (no reservations. This place must be popular as a lot of people flooded the restaurant as it opened its doors. We got seated instantly and were provided with water. Our server was quick to tend to us with appetizers, and drinks and eventually took the order for our main course. We ordered the tuna tataki and the umami sliders as a starter. They were both pretty good as appetizers. The tuna tataki was interesting because the bottom was lined with crispy rice and a sauce was poured over right in front of us which generated a lot of steam from the heated plate. The burger was indeed umami and was cooked to perfect doneness. For the entrees, we got the citrus roll, the salmon sashimi, and the chu toro sashimi. The citrus roll tasted like an average roll you find at other sushi spots. The salmon and tuna sashimi were great as well. Extremely fatty and melted in your mouth as you ate it. However, I can say that it doesn't beat the quality of the chu toro from Hawaii but that shouldn't be expected since we're in CA. The price is somewhat steep if you order nigiri/sashimi, but I'm sure you can get a great meal if you don't order it. But I highly recommend that you get some sashimi or nigiri.",

I'm still dreaming about their cookie dough roll dessert and poke tacos!!I believe that the izakaya bites are truly the reason to visit Mamanoko, and that you should order as many as you can. I will have to go back to try their toro rolls, umami sliders, and miso glazed cod. We ordered the Citrus rolls, Wiki Wiki roll, California roll, and Buddha roll, which all came in generous servings. Our vegan friend was delighted with her vegan Buddha roll and I was a big fan of their classic California roll.The restaurant is higher end with an elegant feel, and a large impressive bar. However, surprisingly there were a lot of children on a weekend night, (perhaps because of the dessert rolls) so it is also definitely family friendly.",

It's a pretty intimate space but as time passes and drinks flow, it can get loud. Speaking of drinks, although I personally didn't drink, everyone else did and loved it! Our waiter gave recommendations and some were skeptical about it, but ended up loving it! They have a full bar and can almost make any drink. In terms of food, it was easily delicious. With a huge number of rolls and nigiri, their fish tastes delicious, but most importantly, fresh. Some rolls (in the omakase) didn't even taste fishy, rather more meaty. Wonderful! I don't normally eat raw fish because they have a funky texture or taste too fishy but it wasn't the case here. In cooked food, their sliders are a MUST HAVE, either the umami or tonkatsu ones - both are bangers and a must order. If you are sharing, then splitting the buns is completely do-able. The chicken kaarage is great. The fritters (or like large tempura pancakes), a wonderful, crunchy, and healthy (filled with veggies!) appetizer!

I loved the large lanterns hanging from the ceiling and the lighting set the perfect ambience for my date night. Our server was very friendly, attentive, and took our order promptly. But as soon as each dish came in, that is when our dining experience began to go downhill.We first started off with the Tuna Tataki and the Umami Sliders.Tuna Tataki: (4/5) This was my favorite dish of the night, but it was still underwhelming. The dish was tasty, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. Although this was a tuna dish, it mimicked the taste of cheesecake factory's miso salmon.Umami Sliders: (2.5/5) I was hesitant to order this as I did go here for the sushi, but my date was craving beef. The sliders made with kobe beef were very dry and crumbled upon each bite. Flavors were ok, but could not get past how dry the burger was.The dishes that I did come here for, the sushi rolls , were the most disappointing. \u00a0When they were placed on our table, these rolls were absolutely stunning. But as soon as we each tried the roll, we both knew that we were not going to come back here again.We ordered the Citrus Roll and the Kinobi roll. Citrus Roll: 2.5/5Kinobi Roll: 2/5Both rolls were visually stunning, but upon trying the citrus roll, I noticed the first piece was broken. I did not think much of it, until I tried one. The rice was extremely sticky and overpowered by a heavy vinegar taste. For the Kinobi roll , the truffle oil and the pepper seasoning did not complement well, and overpowered the dish. My date said the roll reminded him of eating Chinese beef jerky. With all the flavors going on, the two rolls were close to inedible for my date and I. The tuna, salmon, and scallops did not taste fresh. \u00a0Combined with the immensely sticky rice drenched in vinegar as well as the truffle/ pepper flavors, we both struggled to finish these rolls.With the variety of more affordable delicious sushi spots in the bay, I will not be coming back here.",

The room is small but cozy, and has a sliding door for privacy if needed. The staff were great, we were greeted at the door and shown to our table right away, our water and tea were always filled without us having to ask, and both servers always took the time to not only explain each dish, but also answer any questions we may have. It almost feels like we're dining at a friend's house!The food was amazing, it not only looked beautiful, but tasted fantastic. Difficult to choose a favorite as they were all so good. I loved the appetizer plate because not only did it looked great, but the different flavors and textures of each seemed to complement each other. And of course, they were all so cute, being a one bite size! The wagyu was out of this world, so buttery, and just melt in your mouth goodness! The accompanying truffle salt, wasabi, and pepper sauce just lifted the Wagyu to the next level, which I didn't even think was possible!Another memorable dish was the fried tile fish, so simple yet so amazing, the scales on the fried fish just added another dimension to the flavor and texture.Let us not forget the steamed abalone with egg yolk vinegar either, it was served with thinly sliced cucumber and seaweed, and garnished with a piece of pickled ginger flower. Never dreamed of mixing egg yolk with vinegar or knew that it could make such a delicious accompaniment to steamed abalone!The dessert of soy milk pudding with caramel sauce was the perfect ending.Every dish was so delicious, I cannot say enough about the whole meal. I would definitely like to return and taste more of this chef's creations.",

          text: "Located at the top floor on the corner where Ichi-pub was, Kappo Yuji is a very hidden and snug bar with only bar seats and (possibly a private room, which I saw out the corner of my eye). Upon entering, you'll be greeted by your host and seated at the bar where the chef will serve you from. - Amuse - Chawanmushi - 4/5, very delicious snow crab on top of a pretty plain chawanmushi. Unfortunately I couldn't shake the slight hint of dish soap flavor in my chawanmushi. Otherwise, a very good amuse-bouche.- Assorted appetizers - Marinated Mizuna - 3.75/5 - very light, not too flavorful. Slight crunch. Maybe marinate in a stronger soy-vinegar?Boiled Bluefin tuna - Not sure this is actually what I received, so I won't rate this.Miso pickled Egg yolk - 1.5/5 - inventive, quite a thick custardy-chewy texture. Personally I felt it was too big for one bite, and too overwhelming of a single flavor amongst the rest of the (more refreshing) appetizersDaikon wrapped Smoked salmon - 3/5 - slightly bland, but fresh. I enjoyed this almost as much as the monkfish liver.Cod milt with Ponzu sauce - shirako has always been a 'miss' for me, so it probably wouldn't be worthwhile ratMonkfish liver - 4.25/5 - Fairly standard monkfish liver sliced and in light ponzu- Soup -Claypot in Soup (Dobin mushi) - 4.25/5 - I really liked the presentation and flavors of the soup, but again it had a slight hint of dish soap flavor. - Assorted sashimi -Today's fresh fish - 4.75/5 All the sashimi was quite good. My preference is always more towards a tender bit of tuna, whether bluefin or yellowfin, I don't mind - so a change to pieces like Ika was definitely different than what I am used to. The Shiso leaf, shiso flowers, and wasabi were all presented very well with the sashimi.- Grilled Fish -Grilled Chilian sea bass with Shiso paste - 4.5/5 - very tender and juicy fish. With a few drops of yuzu juice, makes for a perfect few bites.- Warm dish - Steamed Sea Perch with Sea urchin - 4.95/5 - My favorite warm dish of the night. It was definitely one of the most flavorful, albeit a bit difficult to actually manage with a spoon. I think it would've been more fitting to serve with chopsticks.- Warm dish - Abalone gratin - 1/5. This really felt out of place for me. Texture was very very chewy, and the gratin almost felt like it'd been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour. - Chef's special -Roasted Japanese Wagyu & Sansho pepper sauce - 6/5 - Definitely the highlight of the menu. This was served with half a brussel sprout and a line of black truffle salt, which reminded me of a previous kaiseki I had in the peninsula. - Sunomono - Seared Belt fish - 3.25/5 - A little bit bland again, I think this would've gone well with a ponzu or similar sauce. - Deep fried dish - Deep fried Tile fish - 4/5 - I wish the fish was salted after deep-fried because the fish itself wasn't very flavorful without salt. It is really neat how tile fish scales are so thin and tender that you can just bite down on it as if it were a very crispy batter. Reminiscent of another restaurant I had in Singapore, which also served tilefish in this exact way.- Rice and Soup - Clay pot cooked steam rice - 3/5 - Personally, I felt the rice may have been cooked a little bit too short. Quite sticky and hard center on the individual rice granule. Akadashi miso soup - 4/5 - red miso soup, a little bit tangy. Very rich flavor.Assorted pickles - 4.25/5 - standard Japanese pickles.- Dessert - Custard pudding - 4.95/5 - Good way to finish. I felt it was a bit too jello-like to be considered a pudding, but that didn't stop me from consuming the whole cup in two bites. It has good flavor, very much like purin - that I would eat all the time as a kid.Overall, the service we received was impeccable, and with a few more years of practice, I can see Kappo Yuji being my go-to for Kappo Kaiseki.",

          text: "One of the best dining experiences I've had in the bay!! It was just as good, if not better, than the michelin-starred Japanese restaurants in SF. The chef has over 25 years in experience in Japan! It's on the 2nd floor - look for the Pagoda Cafe and then take the stairs. There are also only 9 seats- it's a really intimate setting and will make you feel like you're in Japan.Yuji offers a kappo-style omakase (similar to kaiseki), which is rare to find in the Bay Area. I believe Kappo means \"to cut, boil, stew and fry\" so you will experience different Japanese preparation styles with extremely high quality ingredients such as a5 wagyu, truffle and Hokkaido uni.I truly enjoyed every dish here - each dish just got better and better. I definitely think it is worth the price ($180) for the amazing experience you get here. I would highly recommend for a special occasion!",

Up the jenky looking stairs and you'll find \u00a0a small door that looks like a bar. Go through the white curtains and there you'll find yuji. It's only a 8 (or 9?) seat restaurant. It's small, but powerful. Chef Yuji will take you on a journey with his amazing food.My absolute favorite would be the wagyu beef dish. So tender! But each dish was packed with flavor and cooked to perfection. It is pricey, but a great experience. Overall: I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion.",

You have to literally move a construction door out of the way to go upstairs to reach the restaurant. The inside is still pretty dated and could use some fresh paint. The music stopped and started throughout the evening, making it eerily quiet at moments. That being said, the experience was wonderful and the food sublime. Every course was terrific, with the exception of one piece of grilled fish that was cooked slightly too long. I suspect it will become a not so hidden gem soon. We definitely plan to come back.",

The Michelin guide will definitely notice this place; it might have opened too late for Michelin stars later this year though.Practically every dish brings joy. Highlights included wagyu (because, of course) that was seared so perfectly that I'm still ashamed I occasionally try to cook my own wagyu at home. The biggest surprise was a deep-fried tilefish, a sweet and buttery fish rarely seen on menus. But my favorite might have been a simple marinated asparagus; I didn't know a vegetable could do that! The only disappointment was a grilled Spanish mackerel; it was good, just not great, and probably suffered from being surrounded by overwhelmingly-impressive food.",

The meal was fully paid for ahead of time online, so the only thing you need to take care of after the meal is any drinks you might choose to order during your meal.Yuji was a bit difficult to find location-wise. There's no visible signage for the restaurant until you get to the top of the stairs and enter the building. Once you find Yuji, it's a very small and intimate space with only 8 or so seats at the bar.Overall, I had a wonderful experience. The pacing of the meal felt really good as well. From start to finish, our meal ended up being about 2.5 hours. Twelve courses is a lot of food, so come hungry. The highlight of the menu for me was the Japanese wagyu beef that came about halfway through the meal. For my wife, the tempura tile fish was her favorite. Saucing and seasoning is very delicate on each dish. This is probably one of the few times in my life I've had seasoned salt and now I can't get enough of it: truffle salt and matcha salt are incredible. Many dishes feature generous amounts of uni so if you're a fan of uni, you're in for a treat. My least favorite dish was probably the amuse bouche -- the monkfish liver. I did not particularly care for the texture or flavor of the dish. Looking around at some of the other guests dining with us, I could tell this was also not their favorite dish.I think Yuji definitely has the potential for a Michelin star. Come check it out before it becomes impossible to grab a reservation.",

Okay so here's all the details...Located in Japan town there's parking either on street or a parking lot nearby. Inside the pagoda, you walk up all the stairs. There's some construction going on, but it's there! You'll see the pub sign, but then you'll see the white curtains that'll show you the restaurant sign. Upon arrival, you check in. You pick your seating. You are then greeted by the chef, himself... YUJI!I asked him for recommendations for sake by the glass since it was just me drinking and he offered me an off the shelf sake. It paired perfectly well with the dishes. Out of the 12 courses, I wasn't fond of two, but everything else was a 5/5! Some of the dishes were surprising and awed my mind how perfectly cooked some ingredients were delivered. The chef was so kind and it made the experience 1000x better. The diners were also friendly due to the intimate setting. Definitely recommend to everyone.",

          text: "As an objective review, Yuji is a good spot to try a different style of Japanese food. It's not omakase with 10-12 pieces of nigiri. It IS a variety of small dishes liken to Spanish tapas in a tasting menu setting. Location: JapanTown, on the corner, top level of the pagoda. Go up the slightly condemned looking stairs and then you'll see the white curtains. The A5 wagyu is extra fatty and delicious. The girl next to me was brave enough to ask Chef to cook it longer, & he obliged! TBH, it did look amazing with the brown caramelization. Service: There was one host who was also the assistant server. I felt for the pricing, an extra host for more attention would've been better. I don't need to be fawned over but there was a waiting period/time disconnect for service. Hmmm wouldn't return but definitely would recommend if you wanted to try NOT omakase. Personally, I've realized I'm not particular to Kaseki style meals but that doesn't distract from how good the food was at Yuji.",

We started with truffle flavored tofu, topped with caviar, fresh wasabi, and jelly. Then we had a plate with octopus, fish roe cake, shrimp, asparagus, and eggplant w miso sauce. The following sashimi plate had bluefin tuna, stone flounder, and squid. The stone flounder was sooo yummy and the squid was cut so well!! Afterwards we had grilled spanish mackarel, and every bite was flavorful and soft. Next was a steamed fish with uni!!! and black truffle on top,, and then chawanmushi/ steamed egg custard w uni and ikura. The next dish was A5 wagyu with brussel sprouts and pickled cauliflower,, the chef gave us four pieces each :)) soo juicy and soft. There was also japanese conger ( i think it's similar to unagi? i've never had it before but i looved the plum sauce on top ) We also had deep fried fish, and clay pot rice w crab meat!! and a nice mush soup. The dessert was a delicious red bean dessert topped with some strawberries.My personal favorites were the steamed fish w uni & truffle and the uni chawanmushi (I loooooove uni).

It's a very intimate dining experience (9 seater) and Yuji offers a wonderful 12 course tasting menu that expertly goes through the different traditional preparations of Japanese cuisine.Amuse - the first bite is monkfish liver. \u00a0This was nice and fresh and a great start. Assorted Appetizers - this included shredded yam with ikura, boiled and seasoned shrimp, eggplant with miso sauce, roasted duck, broad beans and pickled cherry tomatoes. \u00a0It's a nice combination of small bites and the roasted duck was excellent. Soup - the soup was presented in a tea pot with clams. This was a really nice broth and you can really taste the dashi. \u00a0Sashimi - this was really fresh hirame, ocean trout and o-toro. Grilled Dish - this was a grilled butter fish. This was good but I was hoping for fish that was a bit more flavorful (maybe gindara). Boiled Dish - this was A5 wagyu Shabu Shabu with shaved truffle. This was a unique preparation for me. I'm used to seared wagyu and probably still prefer it that way. \u00a0Warm Dish - I love chawanmushi and this version with Uni and Ikura was one of the best versions I've had. \u00a0Chef's Special - Grilled seaperch hand roll with Uni. This was my favorite dish of the night. \u00a0The generous portion of Uni on top of that perfectly grilled seaperch was a very memorable dish. Sunomono - this was Unagi with vinegar jelly. \u00a0Deep fried dish - this was perfectly deep fried tilefish with crispy scales. \u00a0This was wildly inventive tempura. Rice and soup - steamed rice with red snapper, akadashi miso soup and pickles. \u00a0If you still had room, you won't after this course. Dessert - Matcha warabi mochi with strawberries were the final bites to close out this experience. I really like this tasting menu and it's perfect for that special occasion. It's priced at $180 (around $240 with tax and tip) and given the quality of the ingredients and the experience, I would say that it's great value. Looking forward to my next visit here.

Our favourite dish in order was: \u00a0Wagyu Beef with truffle salt, then the steamed sea perch with generous amount uni and white truffle, then the chawanmushi with uni and ikura. \u00a0The seared belt fish was seared in front of us, carefully sliced, and topped with microgreen and ponzu sauce. \u00a0Th deep fried tile fish was nice and crispy on the top, and firm and moist on the bottom. \u00a0The claypot rice with salmon and maitake mushroom was made in the kitchen, then the claypot brought out covered on the counter. \u00a0The chef was keeping track of when the lid should be opened. \u00a0We all got to see it before he started mixing the ingredients, dishing out the rice, and topped with ikura and a small leaf. \u00a0The soy milk pudding was divine. \u00a0My teenager who dislikes soy milk actually made an exclamation of how delicious it was.This is not your everyday go to place, but definitely a place for special occasion. \u00a0For us, it was my special request to celebrate my birthday.From talking to the chef, the menu does change depending on what is in season. \u00a0So maybe I need to think of another occasion to re-visit.",

Chef Yuji is a master, and Kappo Yuji is a worthy addition to the best of SF's fine dining scene.First, finding the place is a little tricky - from the outside of the building, there are a set of stairs that may be behind a large plywood wall (but ajar) - it seems there are renovations of some kind going on. Go up these stairs from the outside, and enter through a doorway that says Ichi Pub (it is not Ichi Pub) to see a white banner with Kappo Yuji written on it, and enter the white curtains just to the right of it. You'll find a small, understated but elegant dining room with just 9 bar seats facing the counter where Chef Yuji and his colleague will prepare your dinner.At 180pp, the menu is generously proportioned and thoughtfully varied. Every dish was well-seasoned, and even when it showcased the purity of the ingredient, never felt 'simple' or boring. We ate sea bream milt tofu with caviar and wasabi as an opener, and progressed through other courses including a sashimi, a beautiful appetizer plate with a number of small bites (including one of the best shrimps I've had in my life), delicately fried beltfish, melt-in-your-mouth black cod, deliciously meaty wagyu, chawanmushi, and soup you pour yourself from a personal teapot. The only courses out of the 12 that I didn't personally love were the rice + miso soup + pickles (2nd to last course, and intended to fill you up if you weren't already stuffed from the preceding courses - I didn't finish it) and the dessert (matcha pudding - well executed but at this point, I've had a matcha pudding or matcha pannacotta at what seems like a dozen omakase restaurants, and they're all basically the same).We also shared two bottles of sake that Chef Yuji helped us select from the menu, both of which were superb and complemented the meal. (Offer Chef Yuji a glass of sake if you buy a bottle!)Ultimately, Kappo Yuji was delicious and a great value for a meal of this caliber. I expect them to earn a Michelin star if they continue serving food of this quality, and hope to return in the future. Thank you Chef Yuji!",

I ordered around 5:3 PM on a Friday and the delivery time took about 45 minutes!The food was packaged nicely, each roll was packaged separately which I personally like so the sauces don't intertwine. I also got a side of seaweed salad and was pleasantly surprised by the portion size! The sushi was bomb, I got the lion king, deluxe CA and white dragon roll. All were very delicious but I probably would pass on the lion king next time I do delivery. The fish was a little overcooked for me and was very saucy (compared to when I dined in). The deluxe CA was great and they definitely did not skimp on the fillings! I would definitely dine in here and order takeout! The quality of the food for takeout is just as good imo!

Tuna Tartare: I forgot if this was bluefin or regular tuna but I hope it wasn't bluefin. The fish was very fishy and had a strong smell to it which wasn't pleasant. And it seemed like they knew bc the fish was drenched in ponzu which seems to be an attempt to hide the stench. 2/5Dynamite Mussels: Delicious but wasn't as creamy as I had expected. Great flavor though and the mussels were tender. 4.5/5Deluxe California: The only thing deluxe about this is that they substituted imitation crab for fresh snow crab. However the amount of was extremely minimal and mostly rice and cucumbers. 3/5Golden Gate: This one was good but nothing special tbh. 4/5Sashimi: The pieces were extremely thick and hard to eat. The fish was once again a little fishy, but not as much as the tartare. 3/5Overall, wouldn't go back as the fish seems to be fishy here and not as fresh as other places.",

No room rate, but you need to spend at least $400 as a group on food and drink, which for us, was no problem. Karaoke system was easy to use and had a decent song selection. They use the YSK Entertainment system, one that I have used in the past at actual karaoke places. For the most part, the servers got our orders correct. It's tough with a group of twelve, especially if not everyone ends up ordering at the same time, so kudos to the servers for getting all items accounted for. There were some discrepancy with some of the happy hour menu items, but I called the next day, spoke with the manager, and was issued a refund for them. Happy hour items included $5 house sake, $3 edamame, and $1 oysters to name a few. Wasn't crazy about the salmon skin roll, but the geso karaage, (fried squid), fried gyoza, rainbow roll, and the black sesame panna cotta tasted great! I'm glad they gave us the opportunity to order dessert before they ran out. Overall, we had a great time and definitely plan on hosting another social event here in the future!",

We came for my dads birthday and was a party of 7, had a reservation and everything. Was expecting great service based on the 1000+ good reviews they had, but I was WRONG!!! And yes, you definitely will get bubble gets after eating the fish here.The server forgot to put in our 3 dishes (two ramens, and one curry) THREE TIMES!! The first time I can understand, whatever that's fine, mistakes happen, they said they will expedite our order. Cool  The second time we asked, which was like 20 minute after, they tell us they have no pork cutlet available for the curry that we ordered and if we want anything else (which we didn't). Also how are you going to make us wait for food that wasn't even available in first place!!!! \u00a0Mind you, everyone at our table is basically finishing up their meal!!The third time we ask, they said \"they don't know\" what happened to our order and how \"for some reason\" it didn't get placed. At this point, we asked to speak with the manager who was HORRIBLE.. Definitely does not give a crap about the customers, no empathy, we basically wanted accountability for this giant mess, and she was so cold-shouldered and was doing the BARE MINIMUM to fix the situation.. At this point, we just wanted our bill because the three people who did not get their order had lost our appetite. I'm also confused to how they forgot to put in an order for the two ramens we waited an hour for, when the other two people at the table who ordered ramen already received it. How can you miss it?? \u00a0The two menu items are RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER!! We even circled it big and bold!!!!! I think the manager was the worst, the server was apologizing and saying it's his fault etc, but their manager does not set a good example of what customer service should be like. We also asked to remove the 18% service charge because literally half of our table did not even get to eat and we barely got service. \u00a0Very disappointing birthday dinner for my dad, like what the pho kind of customer service is this..",

There are rooms where you can take your shoes off and sit but you'd need to make a reservation ahead of time. Bar area faces the common dining table area. Food: 10/10. I've had their sushi, sashimi, rolls, bowls, robata, and omakase! Every cut is fresh and delicious-- super buttery and literally melts in your mouth. Their salmon belly is to die for! SO fresh and buttery; we get this every time we're here! The orange bowl has large cuts of salmon belly, salmon, and ocean trout sashimi with ikura over rice. One of my go-tos from here! Their omakase is affordable and delicious! Tonkatsu ramen has a nice kick of spiciness to it-- ramen was cooked perfectly and the broth wasn't too salty. Beef curry was really tender and thick; every bite was extremely flavorful. Service: Attentive and food is brought out quickly. Water was refilled periodically and servers were easy to flag down.Overall, I would recommend! Don't forget to make a reservation ahead of time and try a variety of sushi + robata from their menu.",

This is one of my favorite spots in San Francisco and although part of me wants to keep this gem hidden, I know its popularity will inevitably grow, so get your table while you can! The best way to experience Sakesan is with a group of friends, 3 or more. \u00a0This restaurants is hands down, the best value for sushi and bistro serving countless rolls, robata yaki and of course their $1 fresh daily oysters from 4 p.m. - 6 p.m. I have yet to find a restaurant that can compete. Offering \u00a0private-style dinning, modern-sleek seating, and one of the best Karaoke fine dining experiences you can find in the bay area.When you enter the restaurant, you can choose to sit by the illuminated sushi bar, or in one of the gorgeous tatami dinning tables where you will sit shoes-off and legs comfortably placed underneath the table. This comes with a regular reservation, so make sure to arrive early if you want this special seating surrounded by rich, wooden decor and frameless glass separating each table. The Karaoke rooms are available for larger parties 12 people with a minimum charge of $400 and a time limit of 3 hours, or 10 people with a minimum charge of $300 with a time limit of 3 hours. To give you an idea of pricing for a smaller party: I brought a group of 5 friends. We ordered 9 rolls, ramen, Japanese curry, three appetizers, half a dozen oysters and two drinks per person. Our bill was $240, which turned out to be $48 per person. The fish is fresh, the appetizers are hot and sizzling, and the oysters are wonderful. This is one of the best sushi deals you will find in the city that pairs excellently with their extensive list of hot, cold sakes and Japanese draft beers. What I recommend:1) Lion king roll $122) Dragon roll $143) Rainbow $144) Thunder $145) Cherry Blossom $156) Half dozen oysters $67) Dozen oysters $128) Hot sake $89) Draft $6Create food memories,Isabelle Pinard",

We were in the outdoor seating area, but it's covered and there are plenty of heat lamps, so we weren't cold at all. Kanpachi Sashimi: One of my favorite dishes this night. I really liked the wasabi it came with as well.Karaage: Another favorite. These chicken wings tasted unlike any other karaage I've had; they were a little more saucy, almost like there was a soy glaze on top. Really delicious! Chicken thigh yakitori: Loved how you could taste the smokiness.Chicken oyster yakitori: Off the menu but a must get! The chicken was so tender.Hanetsuki Gyoza: These tasted pretty similar to the dumplings you might make at home, but the skirt added a yummy crunch. Kurobuta Tonkatsu: The pork was soft and fatty. Maguro no yukee: Ordered 2 of these but could have done with just 1 because the portion was much bigger than expected. It looks and tastes like a poke bowl. We ended up spending around ~$60 per person. Not a cheap meal, but I think it was well worth it, and we left very full and happy. Will be back!",

We even placed more orders for it! The chicken wings were really good! Not listed above - the cabbage the katsu came with had a yuzu dressing and was really tasty, I definitely could have eaten more of this! What was nice is we had kids eating with us and the server brought out little rice snacks for them to try before dinner. The kids udon was a great portion size too! This is a really cute date night spot or great for groups of 4. There also seemed to be a good size room in the back if you had a large party. Most important tip- make a reservation!

At first we were a bit worried as it was quite cold, but the heater was cranking and we were easily occupied by the food. We ordered a variety of things, all to share and the standouts were the kanpachi crudo and the gyoza, but honestly everything we got I would order again in a hard beat.

We tried the rintaro hanpen oden, yakitori momo sansho, teba no karaage, Kama tama udon. The oden was alright it didn't have a lot of flavor but that may just be the nature of the dish. The Momo sansho was nice it was flavorful and I like the spices it came with. The karaage was flavorful but not really for my taste. Lastly the udon was good but a bit underwhelming, it wasn't as \"carbonara\" as I expected. Overall the dish sizes were small and definitely expensive. It was high quality but I'm just not sure the flavor lived up to the price point. We also tried this plum drink which was actually very good! The aesthetics were nice and the staff was kind as well but our food took a VERY long time to come out and they all came out at very different times so we weren't able to enjoy most of them together.",

I don't believe there was much space for larger groups. Everything seemed to be made carefully with care. Service was friendly and attentive. I generally eat a lot of sushi but this was my first time having Halibut sashimi and while it was a very mild flavor and texture it was SO GOOD.

We paid the same price for a set menu at a fancy French place several weeks prior, but I had a much better dining experience here with both the food and the atmosphere! Maybe because our palates are more adapted to Asian cuisines, and the vibes here are way more relaxed, fun and intimate. We had more than enough to eat. Super glad to have come here for a special occasion (my freshman year roommates and I's last dinner together before our official college graduations).My friend called to make a reservation for omakase. Monday showed up as closed on Google Maps, but they actually still open for omakase by reservation. Will come back to try the \"regular\" restaurant yakitori and izakaya sometime.A cute enclave in the Mission district with outdoor patio vibes and cool indoor seating options. The booths were very intimate, and they get super dark later in the evening with some candles and skylights. Would try sitting at the bar if I come here alone or in a party of 2. There were string lights and lanterns hanging across the walls.Here are the courses for the seasonal omakase menu on May 16, 2022:Zensai, ranked (refreshing, tasty)1. Monterey Abalone with Flowering Rapini2. Wadaman Sesame Tofu with Half Moon Bay Wasabi (pudding-like, not salty)3. Santa Barbara Spot Prawn with Tosazu Zeri (remember to eat the brains haha)4. Smoked and Grilled Sonoma Liberty Duck Breast (very interesting flavor, a little bland)Owan: Spring Chawanmushi with Riverdog Farm Eggs, gulf shrimp, sugar snap peas, asparagus and fava beans (not usually a huge fan of steamed eggs, but this actually tasted like a pudding. the beans and peas added to the texture -- crispy, naturally aromatic and succulent)Sashimi: Ehimi Sakuradai Sea Bream and Kuromaguro Bluefin with Half Moon Bay Wasabi (can't go wrong with this -- bluefin = both tuna and fatty tuna)Agemono: Soft shell crab and chrysanthemum greens tempura with ten tsuyu, grated daikon and ginger (yummy, crispy, juicy yet still light; don't forget to use the dip!)Yakizakana: charcoal-grilled California king salmon yuanyaki with meyer lemon (this was okay; could have been more tender. it looked like Sablefish)Okowa (was pretty full by the time this was served so we packed most of the rice to-go)- rice cooked with California bamboo shoots and shiitake with ume sesame (extremely delicious, comforting yet so unique. probably favorite dish of the meal)- Miso soup with Rintaro tofu and roasted Maitake (i usually don't like miso soup but i enjoyed this)- Karashi daikon, Rintaro umeboshi and takana pickle (mix it into the rice!)Dessert: parfait with bing cherry ice cream and langues de chat (very refreshing, melts-in-the-mouth sorbet, light cookie, sour & sweet cherries)",

Since I had never been to SF before this trip, I consulted a few \"best of\" lists to find the hot spots in the city. Rintaro appeared on a few lists - the food and reviews looked great and it fit perfectly with my desire to try good Asian spots. That being said, I booked a table for our first night in SF and off we went.Rintaro looks unassuming from the outside - it almost has a diminutive entrance, though once inside you're greeted by a lovely courtyard which gives way to a sizable dining area. We arrived shortly before our reservation time, though we ended up waiting close to 30 minutes past our reservation for a table - kind of annoying, but the staff was super apologetic and provided a great service recovery to make up for it. The decor is simple but effective and gives off Japanese restaurant vibes - lots of medium wood tones and touches of color here and there - nothing too over the top, which worked well. The menu is mostly small plates to share, and is mostly divided by type of dish in an order that is recommended. They offer set menus which give you a variety of plates from the menu, though you may also order a la carte. Since there were dishes we wanted to try that were not on the set menus, we decided to order a la carte. But first, a drink - they have barrels of plums in the dining area which they are fermenting to make wine, so we decided to try some. It was great - strong and included a boozy plum which lived up to the adjective. For food, we got the following dishes: teba no karaage (chicken wings), kama tama udon (the noodles were prepared almost carbonara style), hanetsuki gyoza, chiizu tori katsu (chicken stuffed with cheese), yakitori sori, kabocha korokke (potato), ika no nuta (squid), and fried anchovies (don't remember the Japanese name ;-). My favorites were the chicken wings, udon noodles, the tori katsu, and the ika no nuta. If I'm being honest though - they were all so good it's hard to choose standouts. The chicken wings were full of flavor, the noodles were creamy without being too heavy, the cheese in the tori katsu elevated the chicken, and the ika no nuta was served chilled with a tasty mustard sauce mmmm. Service was excellent - everyone we encountered was super friendly and our server especially was totally on top of it. She got us excited for the menu and made excellent recommendations. Overall, I had an excellent experience at Rintaro and would definitely return if I'm ever back in SF.",

I say this because it was cold that night but there are heaters so you're cozy. It doesn't seem like you're in San Francisco at all! Other than ramen and sushi I haven't explored much more in Japanese dining. And this is mostly because I'm vegetarian. I wouldn't say there are a ton of vegetarian options here but there was enough to make me feel like I could come back and enjoy another dinner. We ordered a bunch of things but I'll only comment on the ones I ate-The yosedofu was an interesting dish. We didn't really know how to eat it though and I felt like it would be not cool to ask. But next time I go I will ask because I'm sure I'm not the only one who doesn't get it?? It tasted a bit bland to me, but it also felt like it was supposed to be that way. So it was fine and super filling but I didn't understand this dish. The yakitori eringi was out of this world. My husband who has no dietary restrictions said that this was his favorite dish too. It was so good. The kabocha korokke was also really good. I could eat a million of these. We also got the shungiko kamo sarada with the duck on the side and it was so good!!

Overall, I think it's a great place to go on a date if you order the correct dishes.Things that were very good:- Duck salad with shungiku: I'm more used to eating shungiku, aka tong hao, as a stir fry or in hot pot. They used very tender leaves, so it's uniquely spicy (?) flavor came out, almost like arugula. Paired well with the persimmon and duck.- Chicken skewers: We got the chicken rib and thigh with onion. Both were very tender (and slightly crispy) and came out hot. A little pricey at $10 for 2 skewers, but would still highly recommend. - Kabocha croquettes: Crispy, hot, and freshly fried. Came with curry salt. What else could you ask for?- Kanpachi collar: Tender and nicely grilled. Also came with a spicy yuzu sauce condiment (similar in texture to wasabi) that was very addicting.Things I'd skip:- Udon with duck and mushrooms: Unfortunately, this was some of the less appealing udon noodles that I've had. The noodles themselves were tough and broke easily (as opposed to having elasticity and being soft) - the menu said they were handmade but I've had better frozen udon before. The broth was on the salty/bland side. I mostly only liked the mushrooms.- Shiitake oden with fish cake: Maybe someone who has more experience with oden would be able to weigh in on this - it might have been high quality but my taste buds aren't really picky about this category. I've bought the kind from the grocery store quite a few times, and this seemed somewhat similar to that, so it didn't really feel unique or seem tastier in any way.Ambiance:- Tables weren't seated too closely together which was nice, service was friendly but not too formal (which I liked)- General ambiance reminded me of visiting local registrants in Japan- Boyfriend got multiple mosquito bites on his ankle during the meal even though we were sitting indoors. I think there's some doors that lead to the outside, so would maybe recommend that the \u00a0restaurant use an insect trap or something.Overall, I would come back for the Yakitori or more unique things on the menu!

The vibes on the inside were super nice and felt almost like we were transported to a small little Japanese courtyard with the surrounding decor. Fast and friendly service with delicious food. The portion sizes of everything was just big enough for us to get satisfied. My favorites of the night were definitely the kabocha korokke and the maguro no yukke. The creaminess of the pumpkin paired really nicely with the crispy, fried exterior of the korokke, and the flavor and ingredient combinations for the maguro no yukke were classic but top notch. Nice quality fish too. Amazing food with amazing ambience.CONS: Their wall heaters in the courtyard could maybe do with some adjusting in terms of heating range. Realistically, only the people sitting directly next to them could feel the heat while those sitting on the outside edge tables (us) could barely feel them. If the range can't be adjusted, then they need at least 2 more standing heaters in the courtyard cause I was freezing. Thank god for the waiter who came by and noticed me shivering.

Yakitori momo sansho (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026) - Charcoal-grilled chicken thigh and sansho; like the karaage, the chicken was was tender and moist and the charcoal grill flavor was prominent. \u00a0I liked how they cut eat meat piece so that they were consistently cooked and the togarashi gave it a great kick. \u00a04. \u00a0Karre kabocha korroke (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026) - Potato, kabocha, and curry croquettes with fresh Acme panko, curry salt, and snowy cabbage. \u00a0These were not overly heavy as you might expect with the pumpkin. \u00a0The curry flavor was subtle and liked that it was not the least bit salty. \u00a0We used the tonkatsu sauce as a dressing to the snowy cabbage in addition to pouring on the croquettes.5. \u00a0Maguro no yukke (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026) - Garlicky shoyu-marinated San Diego tuna over hot rice with a raw egg yolk, ume sesame, and Ariake nori; \u00a0the visual says it all, a maguro donburi that doubled as a hand roll when I utilized the provided two nori sheets. \u00a0Delicious and truly reminded me of eating in Japan. 5. \u00a0Hojicha panna cotta (yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026) - Japanese roasted green tea panna cotta with Hojicha syrup and almond cookies; not being a big green tea fan, I enjoyed this though I must admit the seasonal sorbets were awfully tempting. \u00a0I liked that there were three flavor profiles with the syrup and the almond cookie in addition to the panna cotta.My friend glowed about the wonderful food and the atmosphere. \u00a0Before leaving, I went to the restroom and was surprised in a good way. \u00a0Don't want to spoil the surprise. \u00a0The service was exemplary with our waiter (Rintaro S., according to the bill - thanks for the shout-out on my Deli Board shirt) and the young lady who assisted him occasionally. \u00a0They have an extensive sake and beer selection, what you would expect at an authentic Japanese izakaya or perhaps even more. \u00a0I will definitely return and hopefully try the tasting menu or dine in one of the charming booths in the main restaurant.",

I'm so glad I made this visit and my partner also agrees - to this day he still raves about Rintaro.I booked a Friday reservation about a month before using Resy which was linked to their website to make our seating easier. You have the option to sit indoors or outdoors and can make reservations about a month in advance.As we were relatively new to the Izakaya scene, our server suggested that we get their set menu. The only thing about that was that all parties had to get the set menu. (I'm not sure if this applies if you're a party bigger than 2). The set menu consisted of:- Gomadofu: a smooth Sesame \"Tofu\" with Half Moon Bay wasabi- Gindara No Sunomono: miso cured Black cod- Sashimi San Ten Mori: plate with tuna, striped bass, and halibut- Hitokuchi Oden: essentially ingredients stewed in a light dashi broth- Yakitori Tsunkune: grilled minced chicken with egg yolk- Shiromi Zakana Furai: fried minced striped bass and halibut- Rintaro Udon- Mabodofu Don- Hojicha Panna CottaThere were also some other dishes I wanted to try so we grabbed the Chiizu Tori Katsu on top of the set menu.Your food is coursed so your next dishes come out as you finish your previous dishes. It's a nice place for a cozy date. Overall, the experience was wonderful. We enjoyed most of the dishes - besides the Shiromi Zakana Furai which was a fried fish paste (this might also be because we already enjoyed our fried cheese chicken Katsu before and the fried food became overwhelming). They also resumed their Oden service which I'm so glad we had the experience to try. The Oden master told us that the broth is constantly boiling with the vegetables so the depth in flavor gets stronger each time. It was soooo divine yet clean. \u00a0Hands down the best dish was their Hojicha Panna Cotta. I'd probably go back just to grab that Hojicha Panna Cotta. The Hojicha syrup came on the side so you can add as much as you want and adjust the sweetness as preferred. The syrup was a nice balance of sweetness and tea flavor, with that nice astringent taste. It also came with an almond cookie which wasn't like your usual cookie and added a nice crunch to the smooth rich Panna Cotta.We had a wonderful experience at Rintaro and can't wait for the next visit. Definitely do give this place a try, it's worth it!",

Overall, decent plate for the price.- Mabodofu don (tofu and pork over rice): 2/5. Not the most flavorful, but does the job. I've definitely had better tofu dishes elsewhere.- Kamojiru udon (udon with a side of duck): 2/5. Again, this dish wasn't very flavorful.

Highly recommend this one as well, though I believe it may be seasonal.- Franck Peillot wine: A nice white wine to pair with the fish! It was sweet and easy to drink. Recommend this one. :)SERVICE: 2/5. No bueno.The first host was absolutely lovely in greeting and seating us. We made a reservation online and noted a food allergy, and they even texted us beforehand to double check the allergy.Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. Our server was incredibly pushy all night. While we waited for our food, she repeatedly asked us things like: \"Aren't you going to be hungry?\" and \"Don't you want to order more food?\" It made us very uncomfortable.Of course I was starving, but I had no interest in ordering more food if each individual plate was going to take 30 minutes to arrive (yes, 30 minutes).AMBIENCE: 5/5. Gorgeous outdoor eating area, especially at night when the string lights are on (and they have heat lamps to keep you warm). The ambience is the saving grace of Rintaro.Overall, I don't mind paying a premium for a restaurant, but the food has to (at the very least) be good. At Rintaro, it's just meh. The pushy salesmanship from our server killed the vibe of the evening and left a very bad taste in our mouths. :(Tips: If you must go, definitely reserve a table ahead of time. We came in for a Friday dinner reservation and were seated right away. And if you can, check the weather before you go--the tarp outside doesn't protect from rain very well (especially if you're seated around the edges). Good luck!",

Our reservation was at 9pm but we still had to wait a bit to get our table. Quaint little restaurant, felt very japanese.The yosedofu wasnt like those regular silken tofu you get at the supermarket. This was had more texture and I really liked it. Sashimi was very fresh. I usually dont like white fish but the stripped bass was very refreshing. The chicken yakitori was very tender and juicy. It tasted like these pork skewers you would get on the streets in thailand. Nothing too special for the last dish and dessert:Udon was chewy and fish tofu was good. Mabofofu was pretty average. Panna cotta was creamy and nutty, better than the ice cream but this because im not a big fan of sorbet.",

          text: "Rintaro is my favorite restaurant in San Francisco!Starting off with when is the best time to eat here:First off, I would highly recommend making a reservation. This place gets booked up really quickly. I have been able to add myself to the same-day wait list before so that's definitely a possibility. This place is great for smaller parties, I'd say between 2-4 people. Next, let's talk about the food:Every time I come here, I manage to convince everyone to get the tasting menu with me. I've tried to look at the a la carte menu but I always end up getting way to excited about the tasting menu (which gets rotated pretty frequently).What I love about the food is that it is thought out so well. The fixed menu has the best appetizers, and moves into multiple courses. Typically by the main, I'm starting to get full but would have the space for it.One thing that always brings me back is their dessert. My favorite dessert so far is the hojicha pana cotta. It's the perfect balance towards the end of the meal.I also loved their umeshu.Overall:Great place to go for date night or with a small group, the ambiance reminds me of being at a restaurant in Japan.",

The menu changes often as they use fresh, local, and seasonal ingredients. It was a no brainer ordering the \"set menu\" as we get to try a little bit of everything, and let me tell you, literally everything tasted amazing! There wasn't one dish I tried that I didn't like! All the dishes sang in perfect harmony, one right after the next. It was a great experience from beginning to end. This place is a must try!",

They have a set menu, but since we wanted to try things off of it, we ordered a la carte.The yakitori skewers were so moist and flavorful. The katsu, korokke, and karaages were perfectly fried. The yosedofu was so smooth. and reminded me of the Chinese dessert, dofufa. The gyoza was juicy on the inside, and perfectly crispy on the outside. The sashimi was fresh, and the different condiments gave it a nice change in flavor. The rice dish and udon were a perfect way to end since it made sure you were truly full. The duck that came with the udon had to have been the best dish. The hojicha panna cotta was amazing. I loved the crisps that came with it, and the tea of the hojicha syrup was strong. The shukuriima san shu got messy but the sorbets were flavorful. The staff were so understanding, nice, and professional. The service was amazing. I can't wait to come back.",

          text: "This place was amazing. I went with a group of friends late at night (make sure to place your reservations early) and were seated indoors (outdoor seating is also available). The decor is so nice; everything just has a traditional, homey Japanese feel to it. Also the service was wonderful, we were seated quickly, the server was attentive and took our orders promptly, and when they heard that we wanted the chicken oyster skewers (which are very in demand here), they paused in taking our order so they could reserve the last two skewers of the night from the kitchen.In terms of food, everything we got was delicious, and some plates stood out a lot more. Keep in mind that this is an izakaya place so everything is very shareable, but you'll need to order many dishes to satisfy your appetite. In general we ordered croquettes, two different kinds of skewers, a flat breadlike dish, two different kinds of udons, a tonkatsu, and panna cotta. My favorite was definitely the chicken oyster skewers. I had no idea that this was a part of the chicken before, but was very pleasantly surprised by how tender, juicy, and flavorful it was. They definitely prepared it well. I also liked the Maguro no Yukke which is basically like a tuna poke with raw egg for its rich flavor and interesting texture. Finally, the Hojicha Panna Cotta was great, a sweet (but not too sweet) dessert to finish off the night.Since I only really enjoyed some of the dishes and it was quite pricey (around $50 per person), I think I could be persuaded that this place is only 4 stars.",
